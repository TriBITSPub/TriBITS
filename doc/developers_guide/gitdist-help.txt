Usage: gitdist [gitdist options] [OPTIONS]

Run git recursively over extra repos

Instead of typing

   $ git [OPTIONS]

type:

  $ gitdist [gitdist options] [OPTIONS]

This will distribute git options across all git repos listed, including the
base git repo.  The options in [gitdist options] are prefixed with '--dist-'
and are are pulled out before running git on the underlying executable.  See
--help to see the gitdist options.

If --dist-extra-repos="", then the list of extra repos will be read from the
file .gitdist.  The format of this file is to have one repo name per line as
in:

   Repo1
   Repo2
   Repo3
   ...

NOTE: If any extra repository does not exist, then it will be ignored and no
output will be produced.  Therefore, be careful to manually verify that the
script recognizes the repositories that you list.  The best way to do that is
to type 'gitdist status'.

NOTE: This script has no dependencies other than standard linux packagse so it
can be copied and moved anywhere and used.

TIPS:

 - Use 'gitdist --no-pager <command> ...' to get the full output from
   all extra repos in one contiguous stream which can then be piped
   to 'less' or to a file to be read with emacs or vi (may also want
   to use --dist-no-color as well).

 - 'gitdist --help' will run gitdist help, not git help.  If you want git
   help, run raw 'git --help'.

 - By default, gitdist will use 'git' in the environment.  If it can't find
   'git' in the environment, it will require that the user specify the git
   command to run with --dist-use-git=<the command>.

 - To exclude processing either the base git repo and/or other git repos
   listed in .gitdist, pass in --dist-not-base-repo and/or
   --dist-not-extra-repos=RepoX,RepoZ,...  The provides complete control over
   what git repos the given command is run on.

REPO VERSION FILES:

This script also supports the options --dist-version-file=<versionFile> and
--dist-version-file2=<versionFile2> which are used to provide different SHA1
versions for each repo.  Each of these version files is expected to represent
a compatible set of versions of the repos.

The format of these repo version files is a follows:

-----------------------------------------------------
*** Base Git Repo: SomeBaseRepo
e102e27 [Mon Sep 23 11:34:59 2013 -0400] <author1@someurl.com>
First summary message
*** Git Repo: ExtraRepo1
b894b9c [Fri Aug 30 09:55:07 2013 -0400] <author2@someurl.com>
Second summary message
*** Git Repo: ExtraRepo2
97cf1ac [Thu Dec 1 23:34:06 2011 -0500] <author3@someurl.com>
Third summary message
...
-----------------------------------------------------

Each repository entry can have a summary message or not (i.e. use two or three
lines per repo in the file).  A compatible repo version file can be generated
with this script using, for example, using:

   $ gitdist --dist-no-color log -1 --pretty=format:"%h [%ad] <%ae>%n%s" \
    | grep -v "^$" &> RepoVersion.txt

using three lines per repo, or just:

   $ gitdist --dist-no-color log -1 --pretty=format:"%h [%ad] <%ae>" \
    | grep -v "^$" &> RepoVersion.txt

using two lines per repo in the output file.

This allows checking out consistent versions of the repos, diffing two
consistent versions of the repos, etc.

To checkout an older set of consistent versions of the set of repos, use:

  $ gitdist fetch origin
  $ gitdist --dist-version-file=RepoVersion.SomeDate.txt checkout _VERSION_

The '_VERSION_' string will be replaced with the SHA1 for each of the repos.

To tag and branch the set of repos using a consistent set of versions, use:

  $ gitdist --dist-version-file=RepoVersion.SomeDate.txt \
    tag -a some_tag _VERSION_

To diff two sets of versions of the repos, for example, use:

  $ gitdist --dist-version-file=RepoVersion.NewerDate.txt \
     --dist-version-file2=RepoVersion.OlderDate.txt \
     diff _VERSION_ ^_VERSION2_

Here, _VERSION_ is replaced by the SHA1s listed in RepoVersion.NewerDate.txt
and _VERSION2_ is replaced by the SHA1s listed in RepoVersion.OlderDate.txt.

One can construct any git commit taking one or two different repo version
arguments (SHA1s).

Note that the set of repos listed in the RepoVersion.txt file must be a
super-set of those processed by this script or an error will occur and the
script will stop.

Note that this Python script only depends on the Python 2.4+ standard modules
'sys', 'os', 'subprocess', 'commands', and 're'. Also, it requires some
compatible version of 'git' at the very minimum as well of course.


Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dist-use-git=USEGIT
                        The (path) to the git executable to use for each git
                        repo command (default='git')
  --dist-extra-repos=EXTRAREPOS
                        Comma-separated list of extra repos to forward git
                        commands to.  If the list is empty, it will look for a
                        file called .gitdist to get the list of extra repos
                        separated by newlines.
  --dist-not-extra-repos=NOTEXTRAREPOS
                        Comma separated list of extra repos to *not* forward
                        git commands to.  This removes any repos from being
                        processed that would otherwise be.
  --dist-not-base-repo  If set, don't pass the git command on to the base git
                        repo.
  --dist-version-file=VERSIONFILE
                        Path to a file contains a list of extra repo
                        directories and git versions (replaces _VERSION_).
  --dist-version-file2=VERSIONFILE2
                        Path to a second file contains a list of extra repo
                        directories and git versions (replaces _VERSION2_).
  --dist-no-color       If set, don't use color in the output for gitdist
                        (better for output to a file).
  --dist-debug          If set, then debugging info is printed.
  --dist-no-opt         If set, then no git commands will be run but instead
                        will just be printed.
