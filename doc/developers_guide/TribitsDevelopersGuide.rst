Introduction
=============

This document describes the usage of the TriBITS (Tribal Build, Integration,
Test System) to develop software projects.  An initial overview of TriBITS is
provided in the `TriBITS Overview <../overview/TribitsOverview.pdf>`_ document
which contains the big picture and provides a high-level road map to what
TriBITS provides.  This particular document, however, describes the details on
how to use the TriBITS system to create a CMake build system for a set of
compiled software packages.
