:Abstract: This document is generated from the generic template body document ``TribitsBuildQickRefBody.rst`` and provides a general project-independent quick reference on how to configure, build, test, and install a project that uses the TriBITS CMake build system.  The primary audience of this particular build of this document are TriBITS project developers themselves.  A project-specific version of this document should be created and accessed by users of a particular TriBITS-based project.

Introduction
============

This document is created using the script ``create-build-quickref.sh`` in this
directory which just runs::

  $ ./create-project-build-quickref.py \
    --project-name="<Project>" \
    --project-template-file=TribitsBuildQuickRefTemplate.rst \
    --file-base=TribitsBuildQuickRef

to generate this document.  In a project-specific version, ``<Project>`` is replaced with the actual project name (e.g. ``Trilinos``, or ``TriBITSProj``, etc.).  This version of the generated document is referred to by the general TribitsDeveloperGuide.[rst,html,pdf] document.

Below are given genetic versions of the sections that show up in every
project-specific build of this document.

Getting set up to use CMake
===========================

Before one can configure <Project> to be built, one must first obtain a
version of CMake on the system newer than 2.8.1 This guide assumes
that once CMake is installed that it will be in the default path with the name
``cmake``.


Installing a binary release of CMake [casual users]
---------------------------------------------------

Download and install the binary (version 2.8.1 or greater is
recommended) from:

  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html


Installing CMake from source [developers and experienced users]
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you have access to the <Project> git repositories, then install CMake with::

  $ $TRIBITS_BASE_DIR/python/install-cmake.py \
     --install-dir=<INSTALL_BASE_DIR> \
     --do-all

This will result in cmake and related CMake tools being installed in
<INSTALL_BASE_DIR>/bin.

Getting help for installing CMake with this script::

  $ $TRIBITS_BASE_DIR/python/install-cmake.py --help

NOTE: you will want to read the help message about how to use sudo to
install in a privileged location (like the default /usr/local/bin).


Getting CMake Help
==================


Finding CMake help at the website
---------------------------------

  http://www.cmake.org


Building CMake help locally
---------------------------

To get help on CMake input options, run::

  $ cmake --help

To get help on a single CMake function, run::

  $ cmake --help-command <command>

To generate the entire documentation at once, run::

  $ cmake --help-full cmake.help.html

(Open your web browser to the file cmake.help.html)


Configuring (Makefile Generator)
================================

While CMake supports a number of different build generators (e.g. Eclipes,
XCode, MS Visual Studio, etc.) the primary generator most people use on
Unix/Linix system is make and CMake generates exceptional Makefiles.  The
materila in this section, while not exclusing to the makefile generator this
should be assumed as the default.


Setting up a build directory
----------------------------

In order to configure, one must set up a build directory.  <Project> does
*not* support in-source builds so the build tree must be seprate from the
source tree.  The build tree can be created under the source tree such as
with::

  $ $SOURCE_DIR
  $ mkdir <SOME_BUILD_DIR>
  $ cd <SOME_BUILD_DIR>

but it is generally recommended to create a build directory parallel from the
soruce tree.

NOTE: If you mistakenly try to configure for an in-source build (e.g. with
'cmake .') you will get an error message and instructions on how to resolve
the problem by deleting the generated CMakeCache.txt file (and other generated
files) and then follow directions on how to create a different build directory
as shown above.


Basic configuration
-------------------

a) Create a 'do-configure' script such as [Recommended]::

    EXTRA_ARGS=$@
    
    cmake \
      -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=DEBUG \
      -D <Project>_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON \
      $EXTRA_ARGS \
      ${SOURCE_BASE}

  and then run it with::

    ./do-configure [OTHER OPTIONS] -D<Project>_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>=ON

  where ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` is a valid SE Package name (see above), etc. and
  ``SOURCE_BASE`` is set to the <Project> source base directory (or your can
  just give it explicitly in the script).

  See `<Project>/sampleScripts/*cmake` for examples of real `do-configure`
  scripts for different platforms..

  NOTE: If one has already configured once and one needs to configure from
  scratch (needs to wipe clean defaults for cache variables, updates
  compilers, other types of changes) then one will want to delete the local
  CASL and other CMake-generated files before configuring again (see
  `Reconfiguring completely from scratch`_).

.. _<Project>_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE:

b) Create a CMake file fragment and point to it [Recommended].

  Create a do-configure script like::

    EXTRA_ARGS=$@
    
    cmake \
      -D <Project>_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE:FILEPATH=MyConfigureOptions.cmake \
      -D <Project>_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON \
      $EXTRA_ARGS \
      ${SOURCE_BASE}
     
  where MyConfigureOptions.cmake might look like::

    SET(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE DEBUG CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
    SET(<Project>_ENABLE_CHECKED_STL ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    SET(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    ...

  Using a configuration fragment file allows for better reuse of configure
  options across different configure scripts and better version control of
  configure options.

  NOTE: You can actually pass in a list of configuration fragment files
  which will be read in the order they are given.

  NOTE: If you do not use 'FORCE' shown above, then the option can be
  overridden on the cmake command line with -D options.  Also, if you don't
  use 'FORCE' then the option will not be set if it is already set in the
  case (e.g. by another configuration fragment file prior in the list).

c) Using ccmake to configure

  ::

    $ ccmake $SOURCE_BASE

d) Using the QT CMake configuration GUI:

  On systems where the QT CMake GUI is installed (e.g. Windows) the CMake GUI
  can be a nice way to configure <Project> if you are a user.  To make your
  configuration easily repeatable, you might want to create a fragment file
  and just load it by setting `<Project>_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE`_ (see above)
  in the GUI.

Selecting the list of packages to enable
----------------------------------------

The <Project> project is broken up into a set of packages that can be enabled
(or disbled).  For details and generic examples, see `Package Dependencies and
Enable/Disable Logic`_.

See the following use cases:

* `Determine the list of packages that can be enabled`_
* `Enable a set of packages`_
* `Enable to test all effects of changing a given package(s)`_
* `Enable all packages with tests and examples`_
* `Disable a package and all its dependencies`_
* `Remove all package enables in the cache`_

Determine the list of packages that can be enabled
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to see the list of available <Project> SE Packages to enable, just
run a basic CMake configure, enabling nothing, and then grep the output to see
what packages are avaiable to enable.  The full set of defined packages is
contained the lines starting with ``'Final set of enabled SE packages'`` and
``'Final set of non-enabled SE packages'``.  If no SE packages are enabled by
default (which is base behavior), the full list of packages will be listed on
the line ``'Final set of non-enabled SE packages'``.  Therefore, to see the
full list of defined packages, run::

  ./do-configure 2>&1 | grep "Final set of .*enabled SE packages"

Any of the packages shown on those lines can potentially be enabled using ``-D
<Project>_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>:BOOL=ON`` (unless they are forcabily
disabled for some reason, see the CMake ouptut for package disable warnings).

Enable a set of packages
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To enable an SE package ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` (and optionally also its tests
and examples), configure with::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>:BOOL=ON \
  -D <Project>_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
  -D <Project>_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON \

This set of arguments allows a user to turn on ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` as well
as all packages that ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` can use.  All of the package's
optional "can use" upstream dependent packages are enabled with
``-D<Project>_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES=ON``.  However,
``-D<Project>_ENABLE_TESTS=ON`` will only enable tests and examples for
``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` (or any other packages specifically enabled).

If a TriBITS package ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` has subpackages (e.g. ``<A>``,
``<B>``, etc.), then enabling the package is equivalent to setting::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE><A>:BOOL=ON \
  -D <Project>_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE><B>:BOOL=ON \
   ...

However, a TriBITS subpackage will only be enabled if it is not already
disabled either explicitly or implicitly.

Enable to test all effects of changing a given package(s)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To enable an SE package ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` to test it and all of its
down-stream packages, configure with::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>:BOOL=ON \
  -D <Project>_ENABLE_ALL_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
  -D <Project>_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON \

The above set of arguments will result in package ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` and
all packages that depend on ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` to be enabled and have all
of their tests turned on.  Tests will not be enabled in packages that do not
depend on ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` in this case.  This speeds up and robustifies
pre-push testing.

Enable all packages with tests and examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To enable all SE packages (and optionally also their tests and examples), add
the configure options::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
  -D <Project>_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON \

Specific packages can be disabled with
``<Project>_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>:BOOL=OFF``.  This will also disable all
packages that depend on ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>``.

All examples are enabled by default when setting
``<Project>_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON``.

By default, setting ``<Project>_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES=ON`` only enables primary
tested (PT) code.  To have this also enable all secondary tested (ST) code,
one must also set ``<Project>_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TESTED_CODE=ON``.

Disable a package and all its dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To disable an SE package and all of the packages that depend on it, add the
configure options::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>:BOOL=OFF

For example::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_<PACKAGE_A>:BOOL=ON \
  -D <Project>_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
  -D <Project>_ENABLE_<PACKAGE_B>:BOOL=ON \

will enable ``<PACKAGE_A>`` and all of the packages that it depends on except
for ``<PACKAGE_B>`` and all of its forward dependencies.

If a TriBITS package ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` has subpackages (e.g. ``<A>``,
``<B>``, etc.), then disabling the package is equivalent to setting::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE><A>:BOOL=OFF \
  -D <Project>_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE><B>:BOOL=OFF \
  ...

The disable of the subpackage is this case will override any enables.

If a disabled package is a required dependency of some explicitly enabled
downstream package, then the configure will error out if
``<Project>_DISABLE_ENABLED_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES=OFF``.  Otherwise, a WARNING
will be printed and the downstream package will be disabled and configuration
will continue.

Print package dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The set of package dependenices in a project will be printed in the ``cmake``
STDOUT by setting::

  -D <Project>_DUMP_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES:BOOL=ON

Remove all package enables in the cache
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To wipe the set of pakage enables in the CMakeCache.txt file so they can be
reset again from scratch, configure with::

  $ ./-do-confiugre -D <Project>_UNENABLE_ENABLED_PACKAGES:BOOL=TRUE

This option will set to empty '' all package enables, leaving all other cache
variables as they are.  You can then reconfigure with a new set of package
enables for a different set of packages.  This allows you to avoid more
expensive configure time checks and to preserve other cache variables that you
have set and don't want to loose.  For example, one would want to do this to
avoid compiler and TPL checks.

Selecting compiler and linker options
-------------------------------------

The <Project> TriBITS CMake build system offers the ability to tweak the
built-in CMake approach for setting compiler flags.  When CMake creates the
object file build command for a given source file, it passes in flags to the
compiler in the order::

  ${CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS}  ${CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>}

where ``<LANG>`` = ``C``, ``CXX``, or ``Fortran`` and ``<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>`` =
``DEBUG`` or ``RELEASE``.  Note that the options in
``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>`` come after and override those in
``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS``!  The flags in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` apply to all
build types.  Optimization, debug, and other build-type-specific flags are set
in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>``.  CMake automatically provides a
default set of debug and release optimization flags for
``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>`` (e.g. ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG`` is
typically ``"-g -O0"`` while ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE`` is typically
``"-O3"``).  TriBITS provides a means for project and package developers and
users to set and override these compiler flag variables globally and on a
package-by-package basis.  Below, the facilities for manipulating compiler
flags is described.

The <Project> TriBITS CMake build system will set up default compile flags for
GCC ('GNU') in development mode
(i.e. ``<Project>_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=ON``) on order to help produce
portable code.  These flags set up strong warning options and enforce langauge
standards.  In release mode (i.e. ``<Project>_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=ON``),
these flags are not set.  These flags get set internally into the variables
``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS``.

a) Configuring to build with default debug or release compiler flags:

  To build a debug version, pass into 'cmake'::

    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=DEBUG

  This will result in debug flags getting passed to the compiler according to
  what is set in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG``.

  To build a release (optimized) version, pass into 'cmake'::

    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RELEASE

  This will result in optimized flags getting passed to the compiler according
  to what is in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELEASE``.

b) Adding arbitrary compiler flags but keeping other default flags:

  To append arbitrary compiler flags to ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` (which may be
  set internally by TriBITS) that apply to all build types, configure with::

    -D CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS:STRING="<EXTRA_COMPILER_OPTIONS>"

  where ``<EXTRA_COMPILER_OPTIONS>`` are your extra compiler options like
  ``"-DSOME_MACRO_TO_DEFINE -funroll-loops"``.  These options will get
  appended to (i.e. come after) other internally defined compiler option and
  therefore override them.

  Options can also be targeted to a specific TriBITS package using::

    -D <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_<LANG>_FLAGS:STRING="<EXTRA_COMPILER_OPTIONS>"
  
  The package-specific options get appened to those already in
  ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` and therefore override (but not replace) those set
  globally in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` (either internally or by the user in the
  cache).

  NOTES:

  1) Setting ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` will override but will not replace any
  other internally set flags in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` defined by the
  <Project> CMake system because these flags will come after those set
  internally.  To get rid of these project/TriBITS default flags, see below.

  2) Given that CMake passes in flags in
  ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>`` after those in
  ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS``, this means that users setting the
  ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` and ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_<LANG>_FLAGS`` will *not*
  override the flags in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>`` which come
  after on the compile line.  Therefore, setting ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` and
  ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_<LANG>_FLAGS`` should only be used for options that will
  not get overridden by the debug or release compiler flags in
  ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>``.  However, setting
  ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` will work well for adding extra compiler defines
  (e.g. -DSOMETHING) for example.

  WARNING: Any options that you set through the cache variable
  ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>`` will get overridden in the
  <Project> CMake system for GNU compilers in development mode so don't try to
  manually set CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>!  To override those
  options, see ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>_OVERRIDE``.

c) Overriding CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE debug/release compiler options:

  To override the default CMake-set options in
  ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>``, use::

    -D CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>_OVERRIDE:STRING="<OPTIONS_TO_OVERRIDE>"

  For example, to default debug options use::

    -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG_OVERRIDE:STRING="-g -O1" \
    -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG_OVERRIDE:STRING="-g -O1"

  and to override default release options use::

    -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE_OVERRIDE:STRING="-O3 -funroll-loops" \
    -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE_OVERRIDE:STRING="-03 -fexceptions"

  NOTES: The TriBITS CMake cache variable
  ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>_OVERRIDE`` is used and not
  ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>`` because is given a default
  internally by CMake and the new varaible is needed to make the override
  explicit.

d) Appending arbitrary libraries and link flags every executable:

  In order to append any set of arbitrary libraries and link flags to your
  executables use::

    -D<Project>_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS:STRING="<EXTRA_LINK_LIBRARIES>" \
    -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING="<EXTRA_LINK_FLAGG>"

  Above, you can pass any type of library and they will always be the last
  libraries listed, even after all of the TPLs.

  NOTE: This is how you must set extra libraries like Fortran libraries and
  MPI libraries (when using raw compilers).  Please only use this variable
  as a last resort.

  NOTE: You must only pass in libraries in ``<Project>_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS`` and
  *not* arbitrary linker flags.  To pass in extra linker flags that are not
  libraries, use the built-in CMake variable ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS``
  instead.  The TriBITS variable ``<Project>_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS`` is badly named
  in this respect but the name remains due to backward compatibility
  requirements.

e) Turning off strong warnings for individual packages:

  To turn off strong warnings (for all langauges) for a given TriBITS
  package, set::

    -D <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_DISABLE_STRONG_WARNINGS:BOOL=ON

  This will only affect the compilation of the sources for
  ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGES>``, not warnings generated from the header files in
  downstream packages or client code.

  Note that strong warnings are only enabled by default in development mode
  (``<Project>_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE==ON``) but not release mode
  (``<Project>_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE==ON``).  A release of <Project> should
  therefore not have strong warning options enabled.

f) Overriding all (strong warnings and debug/release) compiler options:

  To override all compiler options, including both strong warning options
  and debug/release options, configure with::

    -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING="-O3 -funroll-loops" \
    -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-03 -fexceptions" \
    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=NONE \
    -D <Project>_ENABLE_STRONG_C_COMPILE_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF \
    -D <Project>_ENABLE_STRONG_CXX_COMPILE_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF \
    -D <Project>_ENABLE_SHADOW_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF \
    -D <Project>_ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING:BOOL=OFF \
    -D <Project>_ENABLE_CHECKED_STL:BOOL=OFF \

  NOTE: Options like ``<Project>_ENABLE_SHADOW_WARNINGS``,
  ``<Project>_ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING``, and ``<Project>_ENABLE_CHECKED_STL``
  do not need to be turned off by default but they are shown above to make it
  clear what other CMake cache variables can add compiler and link arguments.

  NOTE: By setting ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=NONE``, then ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_NONE``
  will be empty and therefore the options set in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` will
  be all that is passed in.

g) Enable and disable shadowing warnings for all <Project> packages:

  To enable shadowing warnings for all <Project> packages (that don't already
  have them turned on) then use::

    -D <Project>_ENABLE_SHADOW_WARNINGS:BOOL=ON

  To disable shadowing warnings for all <Project> packages (even those that
  have them turned on by default) then use::

    -D <Project>_ENABLE_SHADOW_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF

  NOTE: The default value is empty '' which lets each <Project> package
  decide for itself if shadowing warnings will be turned on or off for that
  package.

h) Removing warnings as errors for CLEANED packages:

  To remove the ``-Werror`` flag (or some other flag that is set) from being
  applied to compile CLEANED packages like Teuchos, set the following when
  configuring::

    -D <Project>_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS_FLAGS:STRING=""

i) Adding debug symbols to the build:

  To get the compiler to add debug symbols to the build, configure with::

    -D <Project>_ENABLE_DEBUG_SYMBOLS:BOOL=ON

  This will add ``-g`` on most compilers.  NOTE: One does **not** generally
  need to create a fully debug build to get debug symbols on most compilers.


Enabling support for C++11
--------------------------

To enable support for C++11 in packages that support C++11 (either optionally
or required), configure with::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_CXX11:BOOL=ON

By default, the system will try to automatically find compiler flags that will
enable C++11 features.  If it finds flags that allow a test C++11 program to
compile, then it will an additional set of configure-time tests to see if
several C++11 features are actually supported by the configured C++ compiler
and support will be disabled if all of these features are not supported.

In order to pre-set and/or override the C++11 compiler flags used, set the
cache variable::

  -D <Project>_CXX11_FLAGS:STRING="<compiler flags>"


Disabling the Fortran compiler and all Fortran code
---------------------------------------------------

To disable the Fortran compiler and all <Project> code that depends on Fortran
set::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_Fortran:BOOL=OFF

NOTE: The fortran compiler may be disabled automatically by default on
systems like MS Windows.

NOTE: Most Apple Macs do not come with a compatible Fortran compiler by
default so you must turn off Fortran if you don't have a compatible Fortran
compiler.


Enabling runtime debug checking
-------------------------------
  
a) Enabling <Project> ifdefed runtime debug checking:

  To turn on optional ifdefed runtime debug checking, configure with::

    -D <Project>_ENABLE_DEBUG=ON

  This will result in a number of ifdefs to be enabled that will perform a
  number of runtime checks.  Nearly all of the debug checks in <Project> will
  get turned on by default by setting this option.  This option can be set
  independent of ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` (which sets the compiler debug/release
  options).

  NOTES:

  * The variable ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` controls what compiler options are
    passed to the compiler by default while ``<Project>_ENABLE_DEBUG``
    controls what defines are set in config.h files that control ifdefed debug
    checks.

  * Setting ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=DEBUG`` will automatically set the
    default ``<Project>_ENABLE_DEBUG=ON``.

b) Enabling checked STL implementation:

  To turn on the checked STL implementation set::

    -D <Project>_ENABLE_CHECKED_STL:BOOL=ON

  NOTES:

  * By default, this will set -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG as a compile option for all C++
    code.  This only works with GCC currently.

  * This option is disabled by default because to enable it by default can
    cause runtime segfaults when linked against C++ code that was compiled
    without -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG.


Configuring with MPI support
----------------------------

To enable MPI support you must minimally set::

  -D TPL_ENABLE_MPI:BOOL=ON

There is built-in logic to try to find the various MPI components on your
system but you can override (or make suggestions) with::

  -D MPI_BASE_DIR:PATH="path"

(Base path of a standard MPI installation which has the subdirs 'bin', 'libs',
'include' etc.)

or::

  -D MPI_BIN_DIR:PATH="path1;path2;...;pathn"

which sets the paths where the MPI executables (e.g. mpiCC, mpicc, mpirun,
mpiexec) can be found.  By default this is set to ``${MPI_BASE_DIR}/bin`` if
``MPI_BASE_DIR`` is set.

The value of ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` will also automatically be set to
``${MPI_BASE_DIR}/lib`` if it exists.  This is needed for the basic compiler
tests for some MPI implementations that are installed in non-standard
locations.

There are several different different variations for configuring with MPI
support:

a) **Configuring build using MPI compiler wrappers:**

  The MPI compiler wrappers are turned on by default.  There is built-in
  logic that will try to find the right compiler wrappers.  However, you can
  specifically select them by setting, for example::

    -D MPI_C_COMPILER:FILEPATH=mpicc \
    -D MPI_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=mpic++ \
    -D MPI_Fortan_COMPILER:FILEPATH=mpif77

  which gives the name of the MPI C/C++/Fortran compiler wrapper executable.
  If this is just the name of the program it will be looked for in
  ${MPI_BIN_DIR} and in other standard locations with that name.  If this is
  an absolute path, then this will be used as CMAKE_[C,CXX,Fortran]_COMPILER
  to compile and link code.

b) **Configuring to build using raw compilers and flags/libraries:**

  While using the MPI compiler wrappers as described above is the preferred
  way to enable support for MPI, you can also just use the raw compilers and
  then pass in all of the other information that will be used to compile and
  link your code.

  To turn off the MPI compiler wrappers, set::

    -D MPI_USE_COMPILER_WRAPPERS:BOOL=OFF

  You will then need to manually pass in the compile and link lines needed to
  compile and link MPI programs.  The compile flags can be set through::

    -D CMAKE_[C,CXX,Fortran]_FLAGS:STRING="$EXTRA_COMPILE_FLAGS"

  The link and library flags must be set through::

    -D <Project>_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS:STRING="$EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS"

  Above, you can pass any type of library or other linker flags in and they
  will always be the last libraries listed, even after all of the TPLs.

  NOTE: A good way to determine the extra compile and link flags for MPI is to
  use::

    export EXTRA_COMPILE_FLAGS="`$MPI_BIN_DIR/mpiCC --showme:compile`"
    
    export EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS="`$MPI_BIN_DIR/mpiCC --showme:link`"
    
  where ``MPI_BIN_DIR`` is set to your MPI installations binary directory.

c) **Setting up to run MPI programs:**

  In order to use the ctest program to run MPI tests, you must set the mpi
  run command and the options it takes.  The built-in logic will try to find
  the right program and options but you will have to override them in many
  cases.

  MPI test and example executables are passed to CTest ``ADD_TEST()`` as::

    ADD_TEST(
      ${MPI_EXEC} ${MPI_EXEC_PRE_NUMPROCS_FLAGS}
      ${MPI_EXEC_NUMPROCS_FLAG} <NP>
      ${MPI_EXEC_POST_NUMPROCS_FLAGS}
      <TEST_EXECUTABLE_PATH> <TEST_ARGS> )

  where ``<TEST_EXECUTABLE_PATH>``, ``<TEST_ARGS>``, and ``<NP>`` are specific
  to the test being run.

  The test-independent MPI arguments are::

    -D MPI_EXEC:FILEPATH="exec_name"

  (The name of the MPI run command (e.g. mpirun, mpiexec) that is used to run
  the MPI program.  This can be just the name of the program in which case
  the full path will be looked for in ``${MPI_BIN_DIR}`` as described above.
  If it is an absolute path, it will be used without modification.)

  ::

    -D MPI_EXEC_DEFAULT_NUMPROCS:STRING=4

  (The default number of processes to use when setting up and running
  MPI test and example executables.  The default is set to '4' and only
  needs to be changed when needed or desired.)

  ::

    -D MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS:STRING=4

  (The maximum number of processes to allow when setting up and running MPI
  test and example executables.  The default is set to '4' but should be set
  to the largest number that can be tolerated for the given machine.  Tests
  with more processes than this are excluded from the test suite at configure
  time.)

  ::

    -D MPI_EXEC_NUMPROCS_FLAG:STRING=-np

  (The command-line option just before the number of processes to use
  ``<NP>``.  The default value is based on the name of ``${MPI_EXEC}``, for
  example, which is ``-np`` for OpenMPI.)

  ::

    -D MPI_EXEC_PRE_NUMPROCS_FLAGS:STRING="arg1;arg2;...;argn"

  (Other command-line arguments that must come *before* the numprocs
  argument.  The default is empty "".)

  ::

    -D MPI_EXEC_POST_NUMPROCS_FLAGS:STRING="arg1;arg2;...;argn"

  (Other command-line arguments that must come *after* the numprocs
  argument.  The default is empty "".)

  NOTE: Multiple arguments listed in ``MPI_EXEC_PRE_NUMPROCS_FLAGS`` and
  ``MPI_EXEC_POST_NUMPROCS_FLAGS`` must be quoted and seprated by ``';'`` as
  these variables are interpreted as CMake arrays.

Configuring for OpenMP support
------------------------------

To enable OpenMP support, one must set::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_OpenMP:BOOL=ON

Note that if you enable OpenMP directly through a compiler option (e.g.,
``-fopenmp``), you will NOT enable OpenMP inside <Project> source code.


Building shared libraries
-------------------------

To configure to build shared libraries, set::

  -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON

The above option will result in all shared libraries to be build on all
systems (i.e., ``.so`` on Unix/Linux systems, ``.dylib`` on Mac OS X, and
``.dll`` on Windows systems).


Building static libraries and executables
-----------------------------------------

To build static libraries, turn off the shared library support::

 -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF

Some machines, such as the Cray XT5, require static executables.  To build
<Project> executables as static objects, a number of flags must be set::

 -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF \
 -D TPL_FIND_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF \
 -D <Project>_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC:BOOL=ON

The first flag tells cmake to build static versions of the <Project>
libraries.  The second flag tells cmake to locate static library versions of
any required TPLs.  The third flag tells the autodetection routines that
search for extra required libraries (such as the mpi library and the gfortran
library for gnu compilers) to locate static versions.

NOTE: The flag ``<Project>_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC`` is only supported in
cmake version 2.8.5 or higher.  The variable will be ignored in prior releases
of cmake.


Enabling support for an optional Third-Party Library (TPL)
----------------------------------------------------------

To enable a given TPL, set::

  -D TPL_ENABLE_<TPLNAME>:BOOL=ON

where ``<TPLNAME>`` = ``Boost``, ``ParMETIS``, etc.

The headers, libraries, and library directories can then be specified with
the input cache variables:

* ``<TPLNAME>_INCLUDE_DIRS:PATH``: List of paths to the header include
  directories.  For example::

    -D Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS:PATH=/usr/local/boost/include

* ``<TPLNAME>_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING``: List of unadorned library names, in the
  order of the link line.  The platform-specific prefixes (e.g.. 'lib') and
  postfixes (e.g. '.a', '.lib', or '.dll') will be added automatically by
  CMake.  For example::

    -D BLAS_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING="blas;gfortran"

* ``<TPLNAME>_LIBRARY_DIRS:PATH``: The list of directories where the library
  files can be found.  For example::

    -D BLAS_LIBRARY_DIRS:PATH=/usr/local/blas

The variables ``TPL_<TPLNAME>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` and ``TPL_<TPLNAME>_LIBRARIES``
are what are directly used by the TriBITS dependency infrastructure.  These
variables are normally set by the variables ``<TPLNAME>_INCLUDE_DIRS``,
``<TPLNAME>_LIBRARY_NAMES``, and ``<TPLNAME>_LIBRARY_DIRS`` using CMake
``find`` commands but one can always override these by directly setting these
cache variables ``TPL_<TPLNAME>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` and
``TPL_<TPLNAME>_LIBRARIES``, for example, as::

  -D TPL_Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/local/boost/include \
  -D TPL_Boost_LIBRARIES="/user/local/boost/lib/libprogram_options.a;..."

This gives the user complete and direct control in specifying exactly what is
used in the build process.  The other variables that start with ``<TPLNAME>_``
are just a convenience to make it easier to specify the location of the
libraries.

In order to allow a TPL that normally requires one or more libraries to ignore
the libraries, one can set ``<TPLNAME>_LIBRARY_NAMES``, for example::

  -D BLAS_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING=""

Optional package-specific support for a TPL can be turned off by setting::

  -D <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_ENABLE_<TPLNAME>:BOOL=OFF

This gives the user full control over what TPLs are supported by which package
independently.

Support for an optional TPL can also be turned on implicitly by setting::

  -D <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_ENABLE_<TPLNAME>:BOOL=ON

where ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` is a TriBITS package that has an optional
dependency on ``<TPLNAME>``.  That will result in setting
``TPL_ENABLE_<TPLNAME>=ON`` internally (but not set in the cache) if
``TPL_ENABLE_<TPLNAME>=OFF`` is not already set.

WARNING: Do *not* try to hack the system and set::

  TPL_BLAS_LIBRARIES:PATH="-L/some/dir -llib1 -llib2 ..."

This is not compatible with proper CMake usage and it not guaranteed
to be supported.


Disabling support for a Third-Party Library (TPL)
--------------------------------------------------

Disabling a TPL explicitly can be done using::

  -D TPL_ENABLE_<TPLNAME>:BOOL=OFF

NOTE: If a disabled TPL is a required dependency of some explicitly enabled
downstream package, then the configure will error out if
<Project>_DISABLE_ENABLED_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES=OFF.  Otherwise, a WARNING will
be printed and the downstream package will be disabled and configuration will
continue.


Disabling tentatively enabled TPLs
----------------------------------

To disable a tentatively enabled TPL, set::

  -D TPL_ENABLE_<TPLNAME>:BOOL=OFF

where ``<TPLNAME>`` = ``BinUtils``, ``Boost``, etc.

NOTE: Some TPLs in <Project> are always tentatively enabled (e.g. BinUtils
for C++ stacktracing) and if all of the components for the TPL are found
(e.g. headers and libraries) then support for the TPL will be enabled,
otherwise it will be disabled.  This is to allow as much functionality as
possible to get automatically enabled without the user having to learn about
the TPL, explicitly enable the TPL, and then see if it is supported or not
on the given system.  However, if the TPL is not supported on a given
platform, then it may be better to explicitly disable the TPL (as shown
above) so as to avoid the output from the CMake configure process that shows
the tentatively enabled TPL being processes and then failing to be enabled.
Also, it is possible that the enable process for the TPL may pass, but the
TPL may not work correctly on the given platform.  In this case, one would
also want to explicitly disable the TPL as shown above.

Generating verbose output
-------------------------

There are several different ways to generate verbose output to debug problems
when they occur:

.. _<Project>_TRACE_FILE_PROCESSING:

a) **Trace file processing during configure:**

  ::

    -D <Project>_TRACE_FILE_PROCESSING:BOOL=ON

  This will cause TriBITS to print out a trace for all of the project's,
  repositorie's, and package's files get processed on lines using the prefix
  ``File Trace:``.  This shows what files get processed and in what order they
  get processed.  To get a clean listing of all the files processed by TriBITS
  just grep out the lines starting with ``-- File Trace:``.  This can be
  helpful in debugging configure problems without generating too much extra
  output.

  Note that `<Project>_TRACE_FILE_PROCESSING`_ is set to ``ON`` automatically
  when ``<Project>_VERBOSE_CONFIGURE:BOOL=ON``.

b) **Getting verbose output from TriBITS configure:**

  ::

    -D <Project>_VERBOSE_CONFIGURE:BOOL=ON

  This produces a *lot* of output but can be very useful when debugging
  configuration problems.

c) **Getting verbose output from the makefile:**

  ::

    -D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=TRUE

  NOTE: It is generally better to just pass in ``VERBOSE=`` when directly
  calling ``make`` after configuration is finihsed.  See `Building with
  verbose output without reconfiguring`_.

d) **Getting very verbose output from configure:**

  ::

    -D <Project>_VERBOSE_CONFIGURE:BOOL=ON --debug-output --trace

  NOTE: This will print a complete stack trace to show exactly where you are.


Enabling/disabling deprecated warnings
--------------------------------------

To turn off all deprecated warnings, set::

  -D <Project>_SHOW_DEPRECATED_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF

This will disable, by default, all deprecated warnings in packages in
<Project>.  By default, deprecated warnings are enabled.

To enable/disable deprecated warnings for a single <Project> package, set::

  -D <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_SHOW_DEPRECATED_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF

This will override the global behavior set by
``<Project>_SHOW_DEPRECATED_WARNINGS`` for individual package
``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>``.


Disabling deprecated code
-------------------------

To actually disable and remove deprecated code from being included in
compilation, set::

  -D <Project>_HIDE_DEPRECATED_CODE:BOOL=ON

and a subset of deprecated code will actually be removed from the build.  This
is to allow testing of downstream client code that might otherwise ignore
deprecated warnings.  This allows one to certify that a downstream client code
is free of calling deprecated code.

To hide deprecated code for a single <Project> package set::

  -D <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_HIDE_DEPRECATED_CODE:BOOL=ON

This will override the global behavior set by
``<Project>_HIDE_DEPRECATED_CODE`` for individual package
``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>``.


Outputting package dependency information
-----------------------------------------

To generate the various XML and HTML package dependency files, one can set the
output directory when configuring using::

  -D <Project>_DEPS_DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR:FILEPATH=<SOME_PATH>

This will generate, by default, the output files
<Project>PackageDependencies.xml, <Project>PackageDependenciesTable.html, and
CDashSubprojectDependencies.xml.

The filepath for <Project>PackageDependencies.xml can be overridden using::

  -D <Project>_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE:FILEPATH=<SOME_FILE_PATH>

The filepath for <Project>PackageDependenciesTable.html can be overridden
using::

  -D <Project>_DEPS_HTML_OUTPUT_FILE:FILEPATH=<SOME_FILE_PATH>

The filepath for CDashSubprojectDependencies.xml can be overridden using::

  -D <Project>_CDASH_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE:FILEPATH=<SOME_FILE_PATH>

NOTES:

* One must start with a clean CMake cache for all of these defaults to work.

* The files <Project>PackageDependenciesTable.html and
  CDashSubprojectDependencies.xml will only get generated if support for
  Python is enabled.


Enabling different test categories
----------------------------------

To turn on a set a given set of tests by test category, set::

  -D <Project>_TEST_CATEGORIES:STRING="<CATEGORY0>;<CATEGORY1>;..." 

Valid categories include ``BASIC``, ``CONTINUOUS``, ``NIGHTLY``, ``WEEKLY``
and ``PERFORMANCE``.  ``BASIC`` tests get built and run for pre-push testing,
CI testing, and nightly testing.  ``CONTINUOUS`` tests are for post-push
testing and nightly testing.  ``NIGHTLY`` tests are for nightly testing only.
``WEEKLY`` tests are for more expensive tests that are run approximately
weekly.  ``PERFORMANCE`` tests a special category used only for performance
testing.


Disabling specific tests
------------------------

Any TriBTS added ctest test (i.e. listed in ``ctest -N``) can be disabled at
configure time by setting::

  -D <fullTestName>_DISABLE:BOOL=ON

where ``<fulltestName>`` must exactly match the test listed out by ``ctest
-N``.  Of course specific tests can also be excluded from ``ctest`` using the
``-E`` argument.


Setting test timeouts at configure time
---------------------------------------

A maximum default time limit for any single test can be set at configure time
by setting::

  -D DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT:STRING=<maxSeconds>

where ``<maxSeconds>`` is the number of wall-clock seconds.  By default there
is no timeout limit so it is a good idea to set some limit just so tests don't
hang and run forever.  When an MPI code has a defect, it can easily hang
forever until it is manually killed.  If killed, CTest will kill all of this
child processes correctly.

NOTES:

* Be careful not set the timeout too low since if a machine becomes loaded
  tests can take longer to run and may result in timeouts that would not
  otherwise occur.
* Individual tests can have there timeout limit increased on a test-by-test
  basis internally in the project's CMakeLists.txt files (see the ``TIMEOUT``
  argument for ``TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`` and ``TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST()``).
* To set or override the test timeout limit at runtime, see `Overridding test
  timeouts`_.


Scaling test timeouts at configure time
---------------------------------------

The global default test timeout ``DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT`` as well as all of the
timeouts for the individual tests that have their own timeout set (through the
``TIMEOUT`` argument for each individual test) can be scaled by a constant
factor ``<testTimeoutScaleFactor>`` by configuring with::

  -D <Project>_SCALE_TEST_TIMEOUT_TESTING_TIMEOUT:STRING=<testTimeoutScaleFactor>

Here, ``<testTimeoutScaleFactor>`` can be an integral number like ``5`` or can
be fractional number like ``1.5``.

This feature is generally used to compensate for slower machines or overloaded
test machines and therefore only scaling factors greater than 1 are to be
used.  The primary use case for this feature is to add large scale factors
(e.g. ``40`` to ``100``) to compensate for running test using valgrind (see
`Running memory checking`_).

NOTES:

* When scaling the timeouts, the timeout is first truncated to integral
  seconds so an original timeout like ``200.5`` will be truncated to ``200``
  before it gets scaled.

* Only the first fractional digit is used so ``1.57`` is truncated to ``1.5``
  before scaling the test timeouts.

* The cache value of the variable ``DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT`` is not changed in
  the CMake cache file.  Only the value of the timeout written into the
  DartConfiguration.tcl file will be scaled.


Enabling support for coverage testing
-------------------------------------

To turn on support for coverage testing set::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING:BOOL=ON 

This will set compile and link options -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage for GCC.
Use 'make dashboard' (see below) to submit coverage results to CDash


Viewing configure options and documentation
-------------------------------------------
  
a) Viewing available configure-time options with documentation:

  ::

    $ cd $BUILD_DIR
    $ rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/
    $ cmake -LAH -D <Project>_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
      $SOURCE_BASE

  You can also just look at the text file CMakeCache.txt after configure which
  gets created in the build directory and has all of the cache variables and
  documentation.

b) Viewing available configure-time options without documentation:

  ::

    $ cd $BUILD_DIR
    $ rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/
    $ cmake -LA <SAME_AS_ABOVE> $SOURCE_BASE

c) Viewing current values of cache variables:

  ::

    $ cmake -LA $SOURCE_BASE

  or just examine and grep the file CMakeCache.txt.


Enabling extra repositories with add-on packages:
-------------------------------------------------

.. _<Project>_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES:

To configure <Project> with an extra set of packages in extra TriBITS
repositories, configure with::

  -D<Project>_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES:STRING="<REPO0>,<REPO1>,..."

Here, ``<REPOi>`` is the name of an extra repository that typically has been
cloned under the main <Project> source directory as::

  <Project>/<REPOi>/

For example, to add the packages from SomeExtraRepo one would configure as::

  $ cd $SOURCE_BASE_DIR
  $ git clone some_url.com/some/dir/SomeExtraRepo
  $ cd $BUILD_DIR
  $ ./do-configure -D<Project>_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES:STRING=SomeExtraRepo \
     [Other Options]

After that, all of the extra packages defined in ``SomeExtraRepo`` will appear
in the list of official <Project> packages and you are free to enable any of
the defined add-on packages that you would like just like any other <Project>
package.

NOTE: If ``<Project>_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`` and
``<Project>_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE`` are specified then the list of
extra repositories in ``<Project>_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES`` must be a subset and in
the same order as the list extra repos read in from the file specified by
`<Project>_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`_.


Enabling extra repositories through a file
------------------------------------------

.. _<Project>_EXTRAREPOS_FILE:

In order to provide the list of extra TriBIITS repositories containing add-on
packages from a file, configure with::

  -D<Project>_EXTRAREPOS_FILE:FILEPATH=<EXTRAREPOSFILE> \
  -D<Project>_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE=Continuous

Specifing extra repositories through an extra repos file allows greater
flexibility in the specification of extra repos.  This is not helpful for a
basic configure of the project but is useful in automated testing using the
``TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake`` script and the ``checkin-test.py`` script.

The valid values of ``<Project>_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE`` include
``Continuous``, ``Nightly``, and ``Experimental``.  Only repositories listed
in the file ``<EXTRAREPOSFILE>`` that match this type will be included.  Note
that ``Nightly`` matches ``Continuous`` and ``Experimental`` matches
``Nightly`` and ``Continuous`` and therefore includes all repos by default.

If ``<Project>_IGNORE_MISSING_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES`` is set to ``TRUE``, then
any extra repositories selected who's directory is missing will be ignored.
This is useful when the list of extra repos that a given developers develops
or tests with is variable and one just wants TriBITS to pick up the list of
existing repos automatically.

If the file ``<projectDir>/cmake/ExtraRepositoriesList.cmake`` exists, then it
is used as the default value for ``<Project>_EXTRAREPOS_FILE``.  However, the
default value for ``<Project>_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE`` is empty so
no extra repostories are defined by default unless
``<Project>_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE`` is specifically set to one of
the allowed values.

  
Reconfiguring completely from scratch
-------------------------------------

To reconfigure from scratch, one needs to delete the the ``CMakeCache.txt``
and base-level ``CMakeFiles/`` directory, for example, as::
  
  $ rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/
  $ ./do-configure [options]
  
Removing the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file is often needed when removing variables
from the configure line since they are already in the cache.  Removing the
``CMakeFiles/`` directories is needed if there are changes in some CMake
modules or the CMake version itself.  However, usually removing just the
top-level ``CMakeCache.txt`` and ``CMakeFiles/`` directory is enough to
guarantee a clean reconfigure from a dirty build directory.

If one really wants a clean slate, then try::

  $ rm -rf `ls | grep -v do-configure`
  $ ./do-configure [options]

WARNING: Later versions of CMake (2.8.10.2+) require that you remove the
top-level ``CMakeFiles/`` directory whenever you remove the ``CMakeCache.txt``
file.


Viewing configure errors
-------------------------

To view various configure errors, read the file::

  $BUILD_BASE_DIR/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log

This file contains detailed output from try-compile commands, Fortran/C name
managling determination, and other CMake-specific information.


Adding configure timers
-----------------------

To add timers to various configure steps, configure with::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_CONFIGURE_TIMING:BOOL=ON

If you configuring a large number of packages (perhaps including add-on
packages in extra repos) then the configure time might be excessive and
therefore you might want to be able to add configuration timing to see where
the time is being spent.

NOTE: This requires that you are running on a Linux/Unix system that has the
stanard command 'date'.  CMake does not have built-in timing functions so you
have to query the system.


Generating a project repo version file
--------------------------------------

In development mode working with local git repos for the project sources, on
can generate a <Project>RepoVersion.txt file which lists all of the repos and
their current versions using::

   -D <Project>_GENERATE_REPO_VERSION_FILE:BOOL=ON

This will cause a <Project>RepoVersion.txt file to get created in the binary
directory, get installed in the install directory, and get included in the
source distribution tarball.


CMake configure-time development mode and debug checking
--------------------------------------------------------

To turn off CMake configure-time development-mode checking, set::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE:BOOL=OFF

This turns off a number of CMake configure-time checks for the <Project>
TriBITS/CMake files including checking the package dependencies.  These checks
can be expensive and may also not be appropriate for a tarball release of the
software.  For a release of <Project> this option is set OFF by default.

One of the CMake configure-time debug-mode checks performed as part of
``<Project>_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=ON`` is to assert the existence of TriBITS
package directories.  In development mode, the failure to find a package
directory is usually a programming error (i.e. a miss-spelled package
directory name).  But in a tarball release of the project, package directories
may be purposefully missing (see `Creating a tarball of the source tree`) and
must be ignored.  When building from a reduced tarball created from the
development sources, set::

  -D <Project>_ASSERT_MISSING_PACKAGES:BOOL=OFF

Setting this off will cause the TriBITS CMake configure to simply ignore any
missing packages and turn off all dependencies on these missing packages.


Building (Makefile generator)
=============================

This section described building using the default CMake Makefile generator.
TriBITS supports other CMake generators such as Visual Studio on Windows,
XCode on Macs, and Eclipe project files but using those build systems are not
documented here.

Building all targets
--------------------

To build all targets use::

  $ make [-jN]

where ``N`` is the number of processes to use (i.e. 2, 4, 16, etc.) .


Discovering what targets are available to build
-----------------------------------------------

CMake generates Makefiles with a 'help' target!  To see the targets at the
current directory level type::

  $ make help

NOTE: In general, the ``help`` target only prints targets in the current
directory, not targets in subdirectories.  These targets can include object
files and all, anything that CMake defines a target for in the current
directory.  However, running ``make help`` it from the base build directory
will print all major targets in the project (i.e. libraries, executables,
etc.) but not minor targets like object files.  Any of the printed targets can
be used as a target for ``make <some-target>``.  This is super useful for just
building a single object file, for example.


Building all of the targets for a package
-----------------------------------------

To build only the targets for a given TriBITS package, one can use::

   $ make <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_all

or::

   $ cd packages/<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>
   $ make

This will build only the targets for TriBITS package ``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` and
its required upstream targets.


Building all of the libraries for a package
-------------------------------------------

To build only the libraries for given TriBITS package, use::

  $ make <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_libs



Building all of the libraries for all enabled packages
------------------------------------------------------

To build only the libraries for all enabled TriBITS packages, use::

  $ make libs

NOTE: This target depends on the ``<PACKAGE>_libs`` targets for all of the
enabled ``<Project>`` packages.  You can also use the target name
``'<Project>_libs``.


Building a single object file
-----------------------------

To build just a single object file (i.e. to debug a compile problem), first,
look for the target name for the object file build based on the source file,
for example for the source file ``SomeSourceFile.cpp``, use::

  $ make help | grep SomeSourceFile

The above will return a target name like::

  ... SomeSourceFile.o

To find the name of the actual object file, do::

  $ find . -name "*SomeSourceFile*.o"

that will return something like::

  ./CMakeFiles/<source-dir-path>.dir/SomeSourceFile.cpp.o

(but this file location and name depends on the source directory structure,
the version of CMake, and other factors).  Use the returned name (exactly) for
the object file returned in the above find operation to remove the object file
first, for example, as::

  $ rm ./CMakeFiles/<source-dir-path>.dir/SomeSourceFile.cpp.o

and then build it again, for example, with::

  $ make SomeSourceFile.o

Again, the names of the target and the object file name an location depend on
the CMake version, the structure of your source directories and other factors
but the general process of using ``make help | grep <some-file-base-name>`` to
find the target name and then doing a find ``find . -name
"*<some-file-base-name>*"`` to find the actual object file path always works.

For this process to work correctly, you must be in the subdirectory where the
``TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()`` or ``TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()`` command is called
from its ``CMakeList.txt`` file, otherwise the object file targets will not be
listed by ``make help``.

NOTE: CMake does not seem to not check on dependencies when explicitly
building object files as shown above so you need to always delete the object
file first to make sure that it gets rebuilt correctly.


Building with verbose output without reconfiguring
--------------------------------------------------

One can get CMake to generate verbose make output at build type by just
setting the Makefile variable ``VERBOSE=1``, for example, as::

  $ make  VERBOSE=1 [<SOME_TARGET>]

Any number of compile or linking problem can be quickly debugged by seeing the
raw compile and link lines.  See `Building a single object file`_ for more
details.


Relink a target without considering dependencies
------------------------------------------------

CMake provides a way to rebuild a target without considering its dependencies
using::

  $ make <SOME_TARGET>/fast


Testing with CTest
==================

This section assumes one is using the CMake Makefile generator described
above.  Also, the ``ctest`` does not consider make dependencies when running
so the software must be completely built before running ``ctest`` as described
here.


Running all tests
-----------------

To run all of the defined tests (i.e. created using ``TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`` or
``TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST()``) use::

  $ ctest -j<N>

(where ``<N>`` is an integer for the number of processes to try to run tests
in parallel).  A summary of what tests are run and their pass/fail status will
be printed to the screen.  Detailed output about each of the tests is archived
in the generate file::

  Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log

where CTest creates the ``Testing`` directory in the local directory where you
run it from.

NOTE: The ``-j<N>`` argument allows CTest to use more processes to run tests.
This will intelligently load ballance the defined tests with multiple
processes (i.e. MPI tests) and will try not exceed the number of processes
``<N>``.  However, if tests are defined that use more that ``<N>`` processes,
then CTest will still run the test but will not run any other tests while the
limit of ``<N>`` processes is exceeded.  To exclude tests that require more
than ``<N>`` processes, set the cache variable ``MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS`` (see
`Configuring with MPI support`_).


Only running tests for a single package
---------------------------------------

Tests for just a single TriBITS package can be run with::

  $ ctest -j4 -L <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>

or::

  $ cd packages/<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>
  $ ctest -j4

This will run tests for packages and subpackages inside of the parent package
``<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>``.

NOTE: CTest has a number of ways to filter what tests get run.  You can use
the test name using ``-E``, you can exclude tests using ``-I``, and there are
other approaches as well.  See ``ctest --help`` and online documentation, and
experiment for more details.


Running a single test with full output to the console
-----------------------------------------------------

To run just a single test and send detailed output directly to the console,
one can run::

  $ ctest -R ^<FULL_TEST_NAME>$ -VV

However, when running just a single test, it is usally better to just run the
test command manually to allow passing in more options.  To see what the actual test command is, use::


  $ ctest -R ^<FULL_TEST_NAME>$ -VV -N

This will only print out the test command that ``ctest`` runs and show the
working directory.  To run the test exactly as ``ctest`` would, cd into the
shown working directory and run the shown command.


Overridding test timeouts
-------------------------

The configured test timeout described in ``Setting test timeouts at configure
time`` can be overridden on the CTest command-line as::

  $ ctest --timeout <maxSeconds>

This will override the configured cache variable ``DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT``.

**WARNING:** Do not try to use ``--timeout=<maxSeconds>`` or CTest will just
ignore the argument!


Running memory checking
-----------------------

To run the memory tests for just a single package, from the *base* build
directory, run::

  $ ctest -L <TRIBITS_PACKAGE> -T memcheck

Detailed output form the memory checker (i.e. valgrind) is printed in the
file::

  Testing/Temporary/LastDynamicAnalysis_<DATE_TIME>.log

NOTE: If you try to run memory tests from any subdirectories, it will not
work.  You have to run them from the base build directory and then use ``-L
<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>`` or any CTest test filtering command you would like.


Installing
==========

After a build and test of the software is complete, the software can be
installed.  Actually, to get ready for the install, the install directory must
be specified at configure time by setting the variable
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.  The other commands described below can all be run
after the build and testing is complete.


Setting the install prefix at configure time
--------------------------------------------

In order to set up for the install, the install prefix should be set up at
configure time by setting, for example::

  -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/install/<Project>/mpi/opt

The default location for the installation of libraries, headers, and
executables is given by the variables (with defaults)::

  -D <Project>_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH="include" \
  -D <Project>_INSTALL_LIB_DIR:PATH="lib" \
  -D <Project>_INSTALL_RUNTIME_DIR:PATH="bin"

If these paths are relative (i.e. don't start with "/") then they are relative
to ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}``.  Otherwise the paths can be absolute and don't
have to be under ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}``.


Avoiding installing libraries and headers
-----------------------------------------

By default, any libraries and header files defined by in the TriBITS project
<Project> will get installed into the installation directories specified by
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, ``<Project>_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR`` and
``<Project>_INSTALL_LIB_DIR``.  However, if the primary desire is to install
executables only, then the user can set::

   -D <Project>_INSTALL_LIBRARIES_AND_HEADERS:BOOL=ON

which, if in addition static libraries are being built
(i.e. ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF``), this this option will result in no libraries
or headers being installed into the ``<install>/include/`` and
``<install>/lib/`` directories, respectively.  However, if shared libraries
are being built (i.e. ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON``), they the libraries will be
installed in ``<install>/lib/`` along with the executables because the
executables can't run without the shared libraries being installed.


Installing the software
-----------------------

To install the software, type::

  $ make install

Note that CMake actually puts in the build dependencies for installed targets
so in some cases you can just type ``make -j<N> install`` and it will also
build the software.  However, it is advanced to always build and test the
software first before installing with::

  $ make -j<N> && ctest -j<N> && make -j<N> install

This will ensure that everything is built correctly and all tests pass before
installing.


Packaging
=========

Packaged source and binary distributions can also be created using CMake and
CPack.


Creating a tarball of the source tree
-------------------------------------

To create a source tarball of the project, first configure with the list of
desired packages (see `Selecting the list of packages to enable`_) and pass in
::

  -D <Project>_ENABLE_CPACK_PACKAGING:BOOL=ON

To actually generate the distribution files, use::

  $ make package_source

The above command will tar up *everything* in the source tree except for files
explicitly excluded in the CMakeLists.txt files and packages that are not
enabled so make sure that you start with a totally clean source tree before
you do this.  You can clean the source tree first to remove all ignored files
using::

  $ git clean -fd -x

You can include generated files in the tarball, such as Doxygen output files,
by creating them first, then running ``make package_source`` and they will be
included in the distribution (unless there is an internal exclude set).

Disabled subpackages can be included or excluded from the tarball by setting
``<Project>_EXCLUDE_DISABLED_SUBPACKAGES_FROM_DISTRIBUTION`` (the TriBITS
project has its own default, check ``CMakeCache.txt`` to see what the default
is).  If ``<Project>_EXCLUDE_DISABLED_SUBPACKAGES_FROM_DISTRIBUTION=ON`` and
but one wants to include some subpackages that are otherwise excluded, just
enable them or their outer package so they will be included in the source
tarball.  To get a printout of set regular expresions that will be used to
match files to exclude, set::

  -D <Project>_DUMP_CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES:BOOL=ON

While a set of default CPack source generator types is defined for this
project (see the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file), it can be overridden using, for
example::

  -D <Project>_CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR:STRING="TGZ;TBZ2"

(see CMake documentation to find out the types of supported CPack source
generators on your system).

NOTE: When configuring from an untarred source tree that has missing packages,
one must configure with::

  -D <Project>_ASSERT_MISSING_PACKAGES:BOOL=OFF

Otherwise, TriBITS will error out complaining about missing packages.  (Note
that ``<Project>_ASSERT_MISSING_PACKAGES`` will default to ```OFF``` in
release mode, i.e. ``<Project>_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE==OFF``.)


Dashboard submissions
=====================

You can use the TriBITS scripting code to submit package-by-package build,
test, coverage, memcheck results to the project's CDash dashboard.

First, configure as normal but add the build and test parallel levels with::

  -DCTEST_BUILD_FLAGS:STRING=-j4 -DCTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL:STRING=4

(or with some other ``-j<N>``).  Then, invoke the build, test and submit
with::

  $ make dashboard

This invokes the advanced TriBITS CTest scripts to do an experimental build
for all of the packages that you have explicitly enabled.  The packages that
are implicitly enabled due to package dependencies are not directly processed
by the experimental_build_test.cmake script.

There are a number of options that you can set in the environment to control
what this script does.  This set of options can be found by doing::

  $ grep 'SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV(' \
      <Project>/cmake/tribits/ctest/TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake

Currently, this options includes::

  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_TEST_TYPE Nightly )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV(<Project>_TRACK "")
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_SITE ${CTEST_SITE_DEFAULT} )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT "" )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( BUILD_TYPE NONE )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV(COMPILER_VERSION UNKNOWN)
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_BUILD_NAME
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY TRUE )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_WIPE_CACHE TRUE )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR ${DEFAULT_GENERATOR})
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_DO_UPDATES TRUE )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_GENERATE_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE FALSE )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_UPDATE_ARGS "")
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_UPDATE_OPTIONS "")
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS "-j2")
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_DO_BUILD TRUE )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_DO_TEST TRUE )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS 4 )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL 1 )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( <Project>_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS_FLAGS "" )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING FALSE )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND gcov )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_DO_MEMORY_TESTING FALSE )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND valgrind )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_DO_SUBMIT TRUE )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( <Project>_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TESTED_CODE OFF )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( <Project>_ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES "" )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( <Project>_EXCLUDE_PACKAGES "" )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( <Project>_BRANCH "" )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( <Project>_REPOSITORY_LOCATION "software.sandia.gov:/space/git/${CTEST_SOURCE_NAME}" )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( <Project>_PACKAGES "${<Project>_PACKAGES_DEFAULT}" )
  SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV( CTEST_SELECT_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY OFF )

For example, to run an experimental build and in the process change the build
name and the options to pass to 'make', use::

  $ env CTEST_BUILD_NAME=MyBuild make dashboard

After this finishes running, look for the build 'MyBuild' (or whatever build
name you used above) in the <Project> CDash dashboard.

NOTE: It is useful to set CTEST_BUILD_NAME to some unique name to make it
easier to find your results in the CDash dashboard.

NOTE: A number of the defaults set in TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake
are overridden from experimental_build_test.cmake (such as
CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental) so you will want to look at
experimental_build_test.cmake to see how these are changed.  The
script experimental_build_test.cmake sets reasonable values for these
options in order to use the 'make dashboard' target in iterative
development for experimental builds.

NOTE: The target 'dashboard' is not directly related to the built-in
CMake targets 'Experimental*' that run standard dashboards with CTest
without the custom package-by-package driver in
TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake.  The package-by-package extended CTest
driver is more appropriate for <Project>.

NOTE: Once you configure with -D<Project>_ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING:BOOL=ON, the
environment variable CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING=TRUE is automatically set by the
target 'dashboard' so you don't have to set this yourself.

NOTE: Doing a memory check with Valgrind requires that you set
CTEST_DO_MEMORY_TESTING=TRUE with the 'env' command as::

  $ env CTEST_DO_MEMORY_TESTING=TRUE make dashboard

NOTE: The CMake cache variable <Project>_DASHBOARD_CTEST_ARGS can be set on the
cmake configure line in order to pass additional arguments to 'ctest -S' when
invoking the package-by-package CTest driver.  For example::

  -D <Project>_DASHBOARD_CTEST_ARGS:STRING="-VV"

will set verbose output with CTest.
