                      TriBITS Build Quick Reference Files
================================================================================

This directory contains files to create a project-specific build quick
reference document <Project>BuildQuickRef.[rst,html,pdf].  The generic files
used for this purpose are:

  create-project-build-quickref.py
  TribitsBuildQuickRefBody.rst

See `create-project-build-quickref.py --help` for details.

This directory also contains a generic build of a <Project>BuildQuickRef
document.  The template file:

  TribitsBuildQuickRefTemplate.rst

is used to create the auto-generated (read-only) output files:

  TribitsBuildQuickRef.html
  TribitsBuildQuickRef.pdf
  TribitsBuildQuickRef.rst

using the script:

  create-build-quickref.sh

To run the script and update the output files, just do:

  $ cd <this-dir>
  $ ./create-build-quickref.sh

That is all there is to it!

The generated documents are then referred to by other general TriBITS
documentation.
