# NOTE: In order to allow the `tribits` directory to be both a TriBITS package
# (for inclusion in other TriBITS projects) and to be a TriBITS project
# itself, you only have to put in a simple if statement in this top-level
# CMakeLists.txt file and need to use a different package binary directory in
# PackagesList.cmake.  That is all!  In fact, this `tribits` directory shows
# how the same directory can be used for a TriBITS package, a TriBITS
# repository, and a TriBITS project!  However, you can't name the project the
# same as the package, otherwise, TriBITS woiuld try to try to create two
# targets with the name, such as ${PROJECT_NAME}_libs.  Therefore a different
# name and different binary directory must be used for the TriBITS package.
# But that is all.
