Release Notes for TriBITS
----------------------------------------


Trilinos 11.7:
--------------

(*) Switched from the terms Primary Stable (PS) and Secondary Stable (SS) code
to Primary Tested (PT) and Secondary Tested (ST) according to the plan in the
TriBITS Lifecycle model.  Using 'PS' and 'SS' is still allowed but is
deprecated.  This also included deprecating the varible
<Project>_ENABLE_SECONDARY_STABLE_CODE and replacing it with
<Project>_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TEST_CODE.  Again, backward compatibility is
preserved.  Also, the checkin-test.py arg --ss-extra-builds is deprecated and
replaced with --st-extra-builds.


Trilinos 11.6:
--------------

(*) Changed behavior of <Project>_ENABLE_<PACKAGE>=ON to enable all
subpackages for that package including in propogating forward dependencies.
See updated <Project>BuildQuickRef.* document.


Trilinos 11.3:
--------------

(*) Added ENVIRONMENT env1=val1 env2=val2 ... argument to TRIBITS_ADD_TEST(),
TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST(), and TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE_AND_TEST().

(*) Fixed the generation of headers for explicit instantation system for
subpackages: Now subpackages that use the macro
TRIBITS_CREATE_CLIENT_TEMPLATE_HEADERS() to generate XXX.hpp header files with
or without expliict instantation will key off of the parent package's explicit
instantation setting.  In addition, packages that use the macro
TRIBITS_CREATE_CLIENT_TEMPLATE_HEADERS() will also need to add a call to
TRIBITS_ADD_EXPLICIT_INSTANTIATION_OPTION() in their top-level CMakeLists.txt
file.
