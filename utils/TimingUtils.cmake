# Timing utilities
#
# Warning: Depends on calling 'date' program so will not be portable to all
# platforms so call with care.


#
# @FUNCTION: TIMER_GET_RAW_SECONDS()
# 
# Return the raw time in seconds since epoch, i.e., since 1970-01-01 00:00:00
# UTC.
#
# Usage::
#
#   TIMER_GET_RAW_SECONDS(<rawSecondsVar>)
#
# This function is used along with `TIMER_GET_REL_SECONDS()`_, and
# `TIMER_PRINT_REL_TIME()`_ to time big chunks of CMake code for timing and
# profiling purposes.  See `TIMER_PRINT_REL_TIME()`_ for more details and an
# example.
#
# NOTE: This function runs an external process to run the ``date`` command.
# Therefsore, it only works on Unix/Linux type systems that have a standard
# ``date`` command.  Since this runs an external process, this function should
# only be used to time very course grained operations (i.e. that take longer
# than a second).
#

#
# @FUNCTION: TIMER_GET_REL_SECONDS()
#
# Return the relative time between start and stop seconds.
#
# Usage::
#
#   TIMER_GET_REL_SECONDS(<startSeconds> <endSeconds> <relSecondsOutVar>)
#
# This simple function computes the relative number of seconds between
# ``<startSeconds>`` and ``<endSeconds>`` (i.e. from
# `TIMER_GET_RAW_SECONDS()`_) and sets the result in the local variable
# ``<relSecondsOutVar>``.
#
FUNCTION(TIMER_GET_REL_SECONDS  SECONDS_RAW_START
  SECONDS_RAW_END  SECONDS_REL_OUT
  )
  MATH(EXPR SECONDS_REL "${SECONDS_RAW_END} - ${SECONDS_RAW_START}")
  SET(${SECONDS_REL_OUT} ${SECONDS_REL} PARENT_SCOPE)
ENDFUNCTION()


#
# @FUNCTION: TIMER_PRINT_REL_TIME()
#
# Print the relative time between start and stop timers in ``<min>m<sec>s``
# format.
#
# Usage:
#
#   TIMER_PRINT_REL_TIME(<startSeconds> <endSeconds> "<messageStr>")
#
# Differences the raw times ``<startSeconds>`` and ``<endSeconds>``
# (i.e. gotten from `TIMER_GET_RAW_SECONDS()`_) and prints the time in
# ``<min>m<sec>s`` format.  This can only resolve times a second or greater
# apart.  If the start and end times are less than a second then ``0m0s`` will
# be printed.
#
# This is meant to be used with `TIMER_GET_RAW_SECONDS()`_ to time expensive
# blocks of CMake code like::
#
#   TIMER_GET_RAW_SECONDS(REAL_EXPENSIVE_START)
#
#   REAL_EXPENSIVE(...)
#
#   TIMER_GET_RAW_SECONDS(REAL_EXPENSIVE_END)
#
#   TIMER_PRINT_REL_TIME(${REAL_EXPENSIVE_START} ${REAL_EXPENSIVE_END}
#      "REAL_EXPENSIVE() time")
#
# This will print something like::
#
#   REAL_EXPENSIVE() time: 0m5s
#
# Again, don't try to time something that takes less than 1 second as it will
# be recored as ``0m0s``.
#
