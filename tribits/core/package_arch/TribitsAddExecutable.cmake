#
# **Formal Arguments (tribits_add_executable())**
#
#   ``<exeRootName>``
#
#     The root name of the executable (and CMake target) (see `Executable and
#     Target Name (tribits_add_executable())`_).  This must be the first
#     argument.
#
#   ``NOEXEPREFIX``
#
#     If passed in, then ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_`` is not added the beginning of
#     the executable name (see `Executable and Target Name
#     (tribits_add_executable())`_).
#
#   ``NOEXESUFFIX``
#
#     If passed in, then ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX}`` and
#     not added to the end of the executable name (except for native Windows
#     builds, see `Executable and Target Name (tribits_add_executable())`_).
#
#   ``ADD_DIR_TO_NAME``
#
#     If passed in, the directory path relative to the package's base
#     directory (with "/" replaced by "_") is added to the executable name
#     (see `Executable and Target Name (tribits_add_executable())`_).  This
#     provides a simple way to create unique test executable names inside of a
#     given TriBITS package.  Only test executables in the same directory
#     would need to have unique ``<execRootName>`` passed in.
#
#   ``SOURCES <src0> <src1> ...``
#
#     Gives the source files that will be compiled into the built executable.
#     By default, these sources are assumed to be in the current working
#     directory (or can contain the relative path or absolute path).  If
#     ``<srci>`` is an absolute path, then that full file path is used.  This
#     list of sources (with adjusted directory path) are passed into
#     ``add_executable(<exeTargetName> ... )``.  After calling this function,
#     the properties of the source files can be altered using the built-in
#     CMake command ``set_source_file_properties()``.
#
#   ``DIRECTORY <dir>``
#
#     If specified, then the generated executable ``<exeTargetName>`` is
#     placed in the relative or absolute directory ``<dir>``.  If ``<dir>`` is
#     not an absolute path, then the generated executable is placed in the
#     directory ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<dir>/``.  Also, the sources for
#     the executable listed in ``SOURCES <src0> <src1> ...`` are assumed to be
#     in the relative or absolute directory ``<dir>`` instead of the current
#     source directory.  This directory path is prepended to each source file
#     name ``<srci>`` unless ``<srci>`` is an absolute path.  If ``<dir>`` is
#     not an absolute path, then source files listed in ``SOURCES`` are
#     assumed to be in the directory ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/<dir>/``.
#
#   ``CATEGORIES <category0> <category1> ...``
#
#     Gives the `Test Test Categories`_ for which this test will be added.
#     See `tribits_add_test()`_ for more details.
#
#   ``HOST <host0> <host1> ...``
#
#     The list of hosts for which to enable the test (see `tribits_add_test()`_).
#
#   ``XHOST <host0> <host1> ...``
#
#     The list of hosts for which **not** to enable the test (see
#     `tribits_add_test()`_).
#
#   ``HOSTTYPE <hosttype0> <hosttype1> ...``
#
#     The list of host types for which to enable the test (see
#     `tribits_add_test()`_).
#
#   ``XHOSTTYPE <hosttype0> <hosttype1> ...``
#
#     The list of host types for which **not** to enable the test (see
#     `tribits_add_test()`_).
#
#   ``EXCLUDE_IF_NOT_TRUE <varname0> <varname1> ...``
#
#     If specified, gives the names of CMake variables that must evaluate to
#     true, or the test will not be added (see `tribits_add_test()`_).
#
#   ``TESTONLYLIBS <lib0> <lib1> ...``
#
#     Specifies extra test-only libraries defined in this CMake project that
#     will be linked to the executable using ``target_link_libraries()``.  Note
#     that regular libraries (i.e. not ``TESTONLY``) defined in the current SE
#     package or any upstream SE packages can *NOT* be listed!  TriBITS
#     automatically links non ``TESTONLY`` libraries in this package and
#     upstream packages to the executable.  The only libraries that should be
#     listed in this argument are either ``TESTONLY`` libraries.  The include
#     directories for each test-only library will automatically be added
#     using::
#
#       include_directories(${<libi>_INCLUDE_DIRS})
#
#     where ``<libi>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` was set by::
#
#       tribits_add_library(<libi> ... TESTONLY ...)
#
#     Therefore, to link to a defined ``TESTONLY`` library in any upstream
#     enabled package, one just needs to pass in the library name through
#     ``TESTONLYLIBS ... <libi> ...`` and that is it!
#
#   ``IMPORTEDLIBS <lib0> <lib1> ...``
#
#     Specifies extra external libraries that will be linked to the executable
#     using ``target_link_libraries()``.  This can only be used for libraries
#     that are built external from this CMake project and are not provided
#     through a proper `TriBITS TPL`_.  The latter usage of passing in
#     external libraries is not recommended.  External libraries should be
#     handled as declared `TriBITS TPLs`_.  So far, the only case where
#     ``IMPORTEDLIBS`` has been shown to be necessary is to pass in the
#     standard C math library ``m``.  In every other case, a TriBITS TPL
#     should be used instead.
#
#   ``COMM [serial] [mpi]``
#
#     If specified, selects if the test will be added in serial and/or MPI
#     mode.  See the ``COMM`` argument in the script
#     `tribits_add_test()`_ for more details.
#
#   ``LINKER_LANGUAGE (C|CXX|Fortran)``
#
#     If specified, overrides the linker language used by setting the built-in
#     CMake target property ``LINKER_LANGUAGE``.  TriBITS sets the default
#     linker language as follows::
#
#       if (${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_CXX)
#         set(LINKER_LANGUAGE CXX)
#       elseif (${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_C)
#         set(LINKER_LANGUAGE C)
#       else()
#         # Let CMake set the default linker language it wants based
#         # on source file extensions passed into ``add_executable()``.
#       endif()
#
#     The reason for this logic is that on some platform if you have a Fortran
#     or C main that links to C++ libraries, then you need the C++ compiler to
#     do the final linking.  CMake does not seem to automatically know that it
#     is pulling in C++ libraries and therefore needs to be told use C++ for
#     linking.  This is the correct default behavior for mixed-language
#     projects. However, this argument allows the developer to override this
#     logic and use any linker language desired based on other considerations.
#
#   ``TARGET_DEFINES -D<define0> -D<define1> ...``
#
#     Add the listed defines using
#     ``target_compile_definitions(<exeTargetName> ...)``.  These should only
#     affect the listed sources for the built executable and not other
#     targets.
#
#   ``INSTALLABLE``
#
#     If passed in, then an install target will be added to install the built
#     executable into the ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/`` directory (see
#     `Install Target (tribits_add_executable())`_).
#
#   ``ADDED_EXE_TARGET_NAME_OUT <exeTargetName>``
#
#     If specified, then on output the variable ``<exeTargetName>`` will be
#     set with the name of the executable target passed to
#     ``add_executable(<exeTargetName> ... )``.  Having this name allows the
#     calling ``CMakeLists.txt`` file access and set additional target
#     properties (see `Additional Executable and Source File Properties
#     (tribits_add_executable())`_).
#
# .. _Executable and Target Name (tribits_add_executable()):
#
# **Executable and Target Name (tribits_add_executable())**
#
# By default, the full name of the executable and target name
# is::
#
#   <exeTargetName> = ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<exeRootName>
#
# If ``ADD_DIR_TO_NAME`` is set, then the directory path relative to the
# package base directory (with "/" replaced with "_"), or ``<relDirName>``, is
# added to the executable name to form::
#
#   <exeTargetName> = ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<relDirName>_<exeRootName>
#
# If the option ``NOEXEPREFIX`` is passed in, then the prefix
# ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_`` is removed.
#
# The executable suffix ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX}`` will be
# added to the actual executable file name if the option ``NOEXESUFFIX`` is
# *not* passed in but this suffix is never added to the target name.
# (However, note that on Windows platforms, the default ``*.exe`` extension is
# always added because windows will not run an executable in many contexts
# unless it has the ``*.exe`` extension.)
#
# The reason that a default prefix is prepended to the executable and target
# name is because the primary reason to create an executable is typically to
# create a test or an example that is private to the package.  This prefix
# helps to namespace the executable and its target so as to avoid name clashes
# with targets in other packages.  It also helps to avoid clashes if the
# executable gets installed into the install directory (if ``INSTALLABLE`` is
# specified).  For general utility executables on Linux/Unix systems,
# ``NOEXEPREFIX`` and ``NOEXESUFFIX`` should be passed in.  In this case, one
# must be careful to pick ``<exeRootName>`` that will be sufficiently globally
# unique.  Please use common sense when picking non-namespaced names.
#
# .. _Additional Executable and Source File Properties (tribits_add_executable()):
#
# **Additional Executable and Source File Properties (tribits_add_executable())**
#
# Once ``add_executable(<exeTargetName> ... )`` is called and this function
# exists, one can set and change properties on the ``<exeTargetName>``
# executable target using the built-in ``set_target_properties()`` command as
# well as properties on any of the source files listed in ``SOURCES`` using
# the built-in ``set_source_file_properties()`` command just like in any CMake
# project.  IF the executable is added, its name will be returned by the
# argument ``ADDED_EXE_TARGET_NAME_OUT <exeTargetName>``.  For example::
#
#   tribits_add_executable( someExe ...
#     ADDED_EXE_TARGET_NAME_OUT  someExe_TARGET_NAME )
#
#   if (someExe_TARGET_NAME)
#     set_target_properties( ${someExe_TARGET_NAME}
#       PROPERTIES  LINKER_LANGUAGE  CXX )
#   endif()
#
# The ``if(someExe_TARGET_NAME)`` is needed in case the executable does not
# get added for some reason (see `Formal Arguments
# (tribits_add_executable())`_ for logic that can result in the executable
# target not getting added).
#
# .. _Install Target (tribits_add_executable()):
#
# **Install Target (tribits_add_executable())**
#
# If ``INSTALLABLE`` is passed in, then an install target using the built-in
# CMake command ``install(TARGETS <exeTargetName> ...)`` is added to install
# the built executable into the ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/`` directory
# (actual install directory path is determined by
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_RUNTIME_DIR``, see `Setting the install prefix`_).
