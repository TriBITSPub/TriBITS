# @FUNCTION: tribits_write_flexible_package_client_export_files()
#
# Utility function for writing ``${PACKAGE_NAME}Config.cmake`` files for
# package ``${PACKAGE_NAME}`` with some greater flexibility than what is
# provided by the function ``tribits_write_package_client_export_files()``.
#
# Usage::
#
#   tribits_write_flexible_package_client_export_files(
#     PACKAGE_NAME <packageName>
#     [EXPORT_FILE_VAR_PREFIX <exportFileVarPrefix>]
#     [WRITE_CMAKE_CONFIG_FILE <cmakeConfigFileFullPath>]
#     [WRITE_INSTALL_CMAKE_CONFIG_FILE]
#     )
#
# The arguments are:
#
#   ``PACKAGE_NAME <packageName>``
#
#     Gives the name of the TriBITS package for which the export files should
#     be created.
#
#   ``EXPORT_FILE_VAR_PREFIX <exportFileVarPrefix>``
#
#     If specified, then all of the variables in the generated export files
#     will be prefixed with ``<exportFileVarPrefix>_`` instead of
#     ``<packageName>_``.
#
#   ``WRITE_CMAKE_CONFIG_FILE <cmakeConfigFileFullPath>``
#
#     If specified, then the package's (``<packageName>``) cmake configure
#     export file for use by external CMake client projects will be created as
#     the file ``<cmakeConfigFileFullPath>``.  NOTE: the argument should be
#     the full path!
#
#   ``WRITE_INSTALL_CMAKE_CONFIG_FILE``
#
#     If specified, then the package's (``<packageName>``) install cmake
#     configured export file will be installed in to the install tree as well.
#     The name and location of this file is hard-coded.
#
# NOTE: This function does *not* contain the ``install()`` commands because
# CMake will not allow those to even be present in scripting mode that is used
# for unit testing this function.  Instead, the files to be installed are only
# generated in the build tree and the install targets are added else where.
