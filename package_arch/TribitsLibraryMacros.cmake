#
# @FUNCTION: TRIBITS_CONFIGURE_FILE()
#
# Macro that configures the package's main configured header file (typically
# called ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_config.h`` but any name can be used).
#
# Usage::
#
#   TRIBITS_CONFIGURE_FILE(<packageConfigFile>)
#
# This function requires the file::
#
#    ${PACKAGE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/<packageConfigFile>.in
#
# exists and it creates the file::
# 
#   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<packageConfigFile>
#
# by calling the built-in ``CONFIGURE_FILE()`` command::
#
#   CONFIGURE_FILE(
#     ${PACKAGE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/<packageConfigFile>.in
#     ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<packageConfigFile>
#     )
#
# which does basic substitution of CMake variables (see documentation for
# built-in CMake ``CONFIGURE_FILE()`` command for rules on how it performs
# substitutions).
#
# In addition to just calling ``CONFIGURE_FILE()``, this function also aids in
# creating configured header files adding macros for deprecating code as
# described below.
#
# **Deprecated Code Macros**
#
# If ``${PARENT_PACKAGE_NAME}_SHOW_DEPRECATED_WARNINGS`` is ``TRUE`` (see
# `TRIBITS_ADD_SHOW_DEPRECATED_WARNINGS_OPTION()`_), then the local CMake
# variable ``${PARENT_PACKAGE_NAME_UC}_DEPRECATED_DECLARATIONS`` is set which
# adds a define ``<PARENT_PACKAGE_NAME_UC>_DEPRECATED`` (where
# ``<PARENT_PACKAGE_NAME_UC>`` is the package name in all upper-case letters)
# which adds a compiler-specific deprecated warning for an entity.  To take
# advantage of this, just add the line::
#
#   @<PARENT_PACKAGE_NAME_UC>_DEPRECATED_DECLARATIONS@
#
# to the ``<packageConfigFile>.in`` file and it will be expanded at configure
# time.
#
# Then C/C++ code can use this macro to deprecate functions, variables,
# classes, etc., for example, using::
#
#   <PARENT_PACKAGE_NAME_UC>_DEPRECATED class SomeDepreatedClass { ... }.
#
# If the particular compiler does not support deprecated warnings, then this
# macro is defined to be empty.  See `Regulated Backward Compatibility and
# Deprecated Code`_ for more details.

# * `Miscellaneous Notes (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())`_
#
# .. _Formal Arguments (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()):
#
# **Formal Arguments (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())**
#
#   ``<libName>``
#
#     Required name of the library.  This is the name passed to
#     ``ADD_LIBRARY(<libName> ...)``.  The name is *not* prefixed by the
#     package name.  CMake will of course add any standard prefix or post-fix
#     to the library file name appropriate for the platform and if this is a
#     static or shared library build (see documentation for the built-in CMake
#     command ``ADD_LIBRARY()``.
#
#   ``HEADERS <h0> <h1> ...``
#
#     List of public header files for using this library.  By default, these
#     header files are assumed to be in the current source directory.  They
#     can also contain the relative path or absolute path to the files if they
#     are not in the current source directory.  This list of headers is passed
#     into ``ADD_LIBRARY(...)`` as well (which is not strictly needed but is
#     helpful for some build tools, like MS Visual Studio).  By default, these
#     headers will be installed (see `Install Targets
#     (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())`_).
#
#   ``NOINSTALLHEADERS <nih0> <hih1> ...``
#
#     List of private header files which are used by this library. These
#     headers are not installed and do not needed to be passed in for any
#     purpose other than to pass them into ``ADD_LIBRARY()`` as some build
#     tools like to have these listed (e.g. MS Visual Studio).
#
#   ``SOURCES <src0> <src1> ...``
#
#     List of source files passed into ``ADD_LIBRARY()`` that are compiled
#     into header files and included in the library.  The compiler used to
#     compile the files is determined automatically based on the file
#     extension (see CMake documentation for ``ADD_LIBRARY()``).
#
#   ``DEPLIBS <deplib0> <deplib1> ...``
#
#     List of dependent libraries that are built in the current SE package
#     that this library is dependent on.  These libraries are passed into
#     ``TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(<libName> ...)`` so that CMake knows about the
#     dependency structure of the libraries within the package.  **NOTE:** One
#     must **not** list libraries in other upstream SE packages or libraries
#     built externally from this TriBITS CMake project.  The TriBITS system
#     automatically handles linking to libraries in upstream TriBITS SE
#     packages.  External libraries need to be listed in the ``IMPORTEDLIBS``
#     argument instead.
#
#   ``IMPORTEDLIBS <ideplib0> <ideplib1> ...``
#
#     List of dependent libraries built externally from this TriBITS CMake
#     project.  These libraries are passed into
#     ``TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(<libName> ...)`` so that CMake knows about the
#     dependency.  These libraries are added to the
#     ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIBRARIES`` variable so that downstream SE packages
#     will also pick up these libraries and these libraries will show up in
#     the generated ``Makefile.export.${PACKAGE_NAME}`` and
#     ``${PACKAGE_NAME}Config.cmake`` files (if they are generated).  However,
#     not that external libraries are often better handled as `TriBITS TPLs`_.
#     A well constructed TriBITS package and library should never have to use
#     this option.
#
#   ``LINKER_LANGUAGE (C|CXX|Fortran)``
#
#     If specified, overrides the linker language used by setting the built-in  
#     CMake target property ``LINKER_LANGUAGE``.  By default, CMake chooses the 
#     compiler to be used as the linker based on file extensions.
#
#   ``TESTONLY``
#
#     If passed in, then ``<libName>`` will **not** be added to
#     ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIBRARIES`` and an install target for the library will
#     not be added.  In this case, the current include directories will be set
#     in the global variable ``<libName>_INCLUDE_DIR`` which will be used in
#     `TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()`_ when a test-only library is linked in
#     through its ``DEPLIBS`` argument.
#
#   ``NO_INSTALL_LIB_OR_HEADERS``
#
#     If specified, then no install targets will be added for the library
#     ``<libName>`` or the header files listed in ``HEADERS``.
#
#   ``CUDALIBRARY``
#
#     If specified then ``CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY()`` is used instead of
#     ``ADD_LIBRARY()`` where ``CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY()`` is assumed to be defined
#     by the standard ``FindCUDA.cmake`` module as processed using the
#     standard TriBITS ``FindTPLCUDA.cmake`` file (see `Standard TriBITS
#     TPLs`_).  For this option to work, this SE package must have an enabled
#     direct or indirect dependency on the TriBITS CUDA TPL or a
#     configure-time error may occur about not knowing about
#     ``CUDA_ALL_LIBRARY()``.
#
# .. _Include Directories (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()):
#
# **Include Directories (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())**
#
# Any base directories for the header files listed in the arguments
# ``HEADERS`` or ``NOINSTALLHEADERS`` should be passed into the standard CMake
# command ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES()`` *before* calling this function.  These
# include directories will then be added to current packages list of include
# directories ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_INCLUDE_DIRS`` which is then exported to
# downstream SE packages..
#
# .. _Install Targets (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()):
#
# **Install Targets (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())**
#
# By default, an install target for the library is created using
# ``INSTALL(TARGETS <libName> ...)`` to install into the directory
# ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/`` (actual install directory is given by
# ``${PROJECT}_INSTALL_LIB_DIR``, see `Setting the install prefix at configure
# time`_).  However, this install target will not get created if
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_LIBRARIES_AND_HEADERS=FALSE`` and
# ``BUILD_SHARD_LIBS=OFF``.  But when ``BUILD_SHARD_LIBS=ON``, the install
# target will get created.  Also, this install target will *not* get created
# if ``TESTONLY`` or ``NO_INSTALL_LIB_OR_HEADERS`` are passed in.
#
# By default, an install target for the headers listed in ``HEADERS`` will get
# created using ``INSTALL(FILES <h0> <h1> ...)``, but only if ``TESTONLY`` and
# ``NO_INSTALL_LIB_OR_HEADERS`` are not passed in as well.  These headers get
# installed into the flat directory ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/`` (the
# actual install directory is given by
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR``, see `Setting the install prefix at
# configure time`_).  Note that an install target will *not* get created for
# the headers listed in ``NOINSTALLHEADERS``.
#
# .. _Additional Library and Source File Properties (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()):
#
# **Additional Library and Source File Properties (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())**
#
# Once ``ADD_LIBRARY(<libName> ... <src0> <src1> ...)`` is called, one can set
# and change properties on the ``<libName>`` library target using the built-in
# CMake command ``SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES()`` as well as set and change
# properties on any of the source files listed in ``SOURCES`` using the
# built-in CMake command ``SET_SOURCE_FILE_PROPERTIES()`` just like in any
# CMake project.
#
# .. _Miscellaneous Notes (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()):
#
# **Miscellaneous Notes (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())**
#
# **WARNING:** Do **NOT** use the built-in CMake command ``ADD_DEFINITIONS()``
# to add defines ``-D<someDefine>`` to the compile command line that will
# affect any of the header files in the package!  These CMake-added defines
# are only set locally in this directory and child directories.  These defines
# will **NOT** be set when code in peer directories (e.g. a downstream TriBITS
# packages) compiles that may include these header files.  To add defines that
# affect header files, please use a configured header file (see
# `TRIBITS_CONFIGURE_FILE()`_).
