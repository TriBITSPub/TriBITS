# @MACRO: TRIBITS_PROJECT()
#
# Defines and processes a TriBITS project.
#
# Requires that ``PROJECT_NAME`` be defined before calling this macro.
#
# Note, this is just a shell of a macro that calls the real implementation.
# This allows someone to set ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRIBITS_DIR`` in the env and point
# to a different Tribits implementation to test before snapshoting.
#
# ToDo: Give documentation!
