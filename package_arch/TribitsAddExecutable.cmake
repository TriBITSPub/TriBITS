#
#   TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(
#     <exeRootName>  [NOEXEPREFIX]  [NOEXESUFFIX]  [ADD_DIR_TO_NAME]

#     [COMM [serial] [mpi]]
#     [LINKER_LANGUAGE (C|CXX|Fortran)]

# * `Formal Arguments (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_
# * `Executable and Target Name (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_
# * `Additional Executable and Source File Properties (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_
# * `Install Target (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_
#
# .. _Formal Arguments (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()):
#
# **Formal Arguments (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())**
#
#   ``<exeRootName>``
#
#     The root name of the exectuable (and CMake target) (see `Executable and
#     Target Name (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_).  This must be the first
#     argument.
#
#   ``NOEXEPREFIX``
#
#     If passed in, then ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_`` is not added the beginning of
#     the executable name (see `Executable and Target Name
#     (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_).
#
#   ``NOEXESUFFIX``
#
#     If passed in, then ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX}`` and
#     not added to the end of the executable name (see `Executable and
#     Target Name (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_).
#
#   ``ADD_DIR_TO_NAME``
#
#     If passed in, the directory path relative to the package's base
#     directory (with "/" replaced by "_") is added to the executable name
#     (see `Executable and Target Name (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_).  This
#     provides a simple way to create unique test exectuable names inside of a
#     given TriBITS package.  Only test executables in the same directory
#     would need to have unique ``<execRootName>`` passed in.
#
#   ``SOURCES <src0> <src1> ...``
#
#     Gives the source files that will be compiled into the built executable.
#     By default, these sources are assumed to be in the current working
#     directory (or can contain the relative path or absolute path).  If
#     ``<srci>`` is an absolute path, then that full file path is used.  This
#     list of sources (with adjusted directory path) are passed into
#     ``ADD_EXECUTABLE(<fullExeName> ... )``.  After calling this function,
#     the properties of the source files can be altered using the built-in
#     CMake command ``SET_SOURCE_FILE_PROPERTIES()``.
#
#   ``DIRECTORY <dir>``
#
#     If specified, then the sources for the executable listed in ``SOURCES
#     <src0> <src1> ...`` are assumed to be in the relative or absolute
#     directory ``<dir>`` instead of the current source directory.  This
#     directory path is prepended to each source file name ``<srci>`` unless
#     ``<srci>`` is an absolute path.
#
#   ``CATEGORIES <category0> <category1> ...``
#
#     Gives the `Test Test Categories`_ for which this test will be added.
#     See `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_ for more details.
#
#   ``HOST <host0> <host1> ...``
#
#     The list of hosts for which to enable the test (see `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_).
#
#   ``XHOST <host0> <host1> ...``
#
#     The list of hosts for which **not** to enable the test (see
#     `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_).
#
#   ``HOSTTYPE <hosttype0> <hosttype1> ...``
#
#     The list of host types for which to enable the test (see
#     `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_).
#
#   ``XHOSTTYPE <hosttype0> <hosttype1> ...``
#
#     The list of host types for which **not** to enable the test (see
#     `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_).
#
#   ``DEPLIBS <lib0> <lib1> ...``
#
#     Specifies extra libraries that will be linked to the executable using
#     ``TARGET_LINK_LIBRARY()``.  Note that regular libraries (i.e. not
#     ``TESTONLY``) defined in the current SE package or any upstream SE
#     packages do **NOT** need to be listed!  TriBITS automatically links non
#     ``TESTONLY`` libraries in this package and upstream packages to the
#     executable.  The only libraries that should be listed in this argument
#     are either ``TESTONLY`` libraries, or other libraries that are built
#     external from this CMake project and are not provided through a proper
#     `TriBITS TPL`_.  The latter usage of passing in external libraries is
#     not recommended.  External libraries should be handled as declared
#     `TriBITS TPLs`_.  For a ``TESTONLY`` library, the include directories
#     will automatically be added using::
#
#       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${<libi>_INCLUDE_DIRS})
#
#     where ``<libi>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` was set by::
#
#       TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY(<libi> ... TESTONLY ...)
#
#     Therefore, to link to a defined ``TESTONLY`` library in any upstream
#     enabled package, one just needs to pass in the library name through
#     ``DEPLIBS ... <libi> ...`` and that is it!
#
#   ``COMM [serial] [mpi]``
#
#     If specified, selects if the test will be added in serial and/or MPI
#     mode.  See the ``COMM`` argument in the script
#     `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_ for more details.
#
#   ``LINKER_LANGUAGE (C|CXX|Fortran)``
#
#     If specified, overrides the linker language used by setting the built-in
#     CMake target property ``LINKER_LANGUAGE``.  By default, CMake chooses the
#     compiler to be used as the linker based on file extensions.  The most
#     typical use case for this option is when Fortran-only or C-only sources
#     are passed in through ``SOURCES`` but a C++ linker is needed because
#     there are upstream C++ libraries.
#
#   ``DEFINES -D<define0> -D<define1> ...``
#
#     Add the listed defines using ``ADD_DEFINITIONS()``.  These should only
#     affect the listed sources for the built executable and not other
#     compiles in this directory due to the FUNCTION scoping.
#
#   ``INSTALLABLE``
#
#     If passed in, then an install target will be added to install the built
#     executable into the ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/`` directory (see
#     `Install Target (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_).
#
# .. _Executable and Target Name (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()):
#
# **Executable and Target Name (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())**
#
# By default, the full name of the executable and target name
# is::
#
#   <fullExecName> = ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<exeRootName>
#
# If ``ADD_DIR_TO_NAME`` is set, then the directory path relative to the
# package base directory (with "/" replaced with "_"), or ``<relDirName>``, is
# added to the executable name to form::
#
#   <fullExecName> = ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<relDirName>_<exeRootName>
#
# If the option ``NOEXEPREFIX`` is passed in, then the prefix
# ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_`` is removed.
#
# The executable suffix ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX}`` will be
# added to the actual executable file name if the option ``NOEXESUFFIX`` is
# *not* passed in but this suffix is never added to the target name.
#
# The reason that a default prefix is prepended to the executable and target
# name is because the primary reason to create an executable is typically to
# create a test or an example that is private to the package.  This prefix
# helps to namespace the executable and its target so as to avoid name clashes
# with targets in other packages.  It also helps to avoid clashes if the
# executable gets installed into the install directory (if ``INSTALLABLE`` is
# specified).  For general utility executables on Linux/Unix systems,
# ``NOEXEPREFIX`` and ``NOEXESUFFIX`` should be passed in.  In this case, one
# must be careful to pick ``<exeRootName>`` that will be sufficiently globally
# unique.  Please use common sense when picking non-namespaced names.
#
# .. _Additional Executable and Source File Properties (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()):
#
# **Additional Executable and Source File Properties (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())**
#
# Once ``ADD_EXECUTABLE(<fullExeName> ... )`` is called and this function
# exists, one can set and change properties on the ``<fullExeName>``
# executable target using the built-in ``SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES()`` command as
# well as properties on any of the source files listed in ``SOURCES`` using
# the built-in ``SET_SOURCE_FILE_PROPERTIES()`` command just like in any CMake
# project.
#
# .. _Install Target (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()):
#
# **Install Target (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())**
#
# If ``INSTALLABLE`` is passed in, then an install target using the built-in
# CMake command ``INSTALL(TARGETS <fullExeName> ...)`` is added to install the
# built executable into the ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/`` directory (actual
# install directory path is determined by
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_RUNTIME_DIR``, see `Setting the install prefix at
# configure time`_) .
