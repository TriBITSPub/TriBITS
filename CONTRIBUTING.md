Contributions to TriBITS are welcomed.  However, there are some [requirements](#requirements) that every contribution needs to follow before it can be integrated into the main development branch of TriBITS and there is a [recommended process](#process) for suggesting and submitted proposed changes.

**NOTE:** See GitHub documentation for overviews and the mechanical steps to create a [GitHub fork](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/), [push topic branches](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/), and [create pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).  That documentation and links should provide everything you should need to know about how to perform those standard GitHub tasks.  Those mechanical steps are **not** repeated here.

**NOTE:** All contributions that are submitted are assumed to be given under the **[3-clause BSD-like TriBITS License](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/blob/master/tribits/Copyright.txt).**  (By submitting a Pull Request, the contributor is implicitly putting their contribution under this license.)

## Requirements for every change to TriBITS

1. **Automated Tests:** Any change in behavior or new behavior needs to be accompanied with automated tests to define and protect these changes.  If automated tests are not possible or too difficult, this can be discussed in the GitHub Issue or Pull Request (see below).
2. **GitHub Issue:** All non-trivial changes should have a [GitHub Issue created](#process_create_issue) for them and all associated commits should list the GitHub Issue ID in the commit logs.
3. **Documentation:** Any new feature or change in the behavior of an existing feature must be fully documented before it is accepted.  This documentation is generally added to one or more of the following places:
   * Implementation `*.cmake` file itself (formatted with restructuredText and pulled out automatically into the TriBITS Developers Guide, see existing examples)
   * `TribitsUsersGuide.rst` document (under `tribits/doc/guides/users_guide/`)
   * `TribitsMaintainersGuide.rst` document (under `tribits/doc/guides/maintainers_guide/`)
   * `TribitsBuildReferenceBody.rst` document (under `tribits/doc/build_ref/`)

**NOTE**: All of these tasks may not need to be done by a external contributor.  It is just that *someone* will need to do all of this before a contribution can be merged into the main development branch of the TriBITS repo.

## Preferred process for suggesting and making changes to TriBITS

<a name="process_outline">

### Process Outline

The steps in the preferred process for making changes to TriBITS are:

1. [Create GitHub Issue](#process_create_issue) (communicate about the requirements and design)
2. [Create Pull Request](#process_create_pull_request) (each commit references the GitHub Issue ID)
3. [Perform Code Review](#process_code_review) (perhaps adding new commits to address issues)
4. [Accept Pull Request](#process_accept_pull_request) (merge/rebase and push the branch to 'master')

The details are given [below](#process_details).

<a name="process_roles"/>

### Process roles

The following roles are mentioned on the process descriptions:

* **TriBITS Maintainer**: Individual with push rights to the main TriBITS repo (i.e. [@bartlettroscoe](https://github.com/bartlettroscoe)).  Must review all issues and suggested changes and accept pull-requests.
* **TriBITS Developer**: Someone who knows how to build TriBITS as a CMake project with its tests, add tests, make acceptable changes, create pull-requests, etc. but may not be able to directly push to the main TriBITS development branch (see the role of [TriBITS System Developer](https://tribitspub.github.io/TriBITS/maintainers_guide/index.html#tribits-system-developer)).
* **TriBITS Reviewer**: A member of the TriBITS Collaborators who have permission to review and approve Pull Requests (and change other aspects of a Pull Request).
* **Issue Reporter**: A person who first reports an issue with TriBITS and would like some type of change to happen (i.e. to fix a defect, implement a new feature, fix documentation, etc.).

NOTE: The same individual may perform multiple roles.  (For example, the Issue Reporter may also be a TriBITS Developer.  Also, a TriBITS Reviewer may also be a TriBITS Developer or TriBITS Maintainer.)

### Process Details

With the above definitions in place, the recommended/preferred process for contributing to TriBITS is:

<a name="process_create_issue"/>

1. **Create GitHub Issue:** The Issue Reporter should submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/issues) (e.g. with ID `123`) proposing the change (see [Kanban Process](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/wiki/Kanban-Process-for-Issue-Tracking) used to manage TriBITS Issues).  That way, a conversation can be started to make sure the right contribution is made and to avoid wasted effort in case a suggested change can't be accepted for some reason.  (The TriBITS Maintainer or a TriBITS Developer will assign the appropriate `component` and `type` [Issue Labels](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/labels).)   **If the TriBITS Maintainer decides that the proposed change is not appropriate, then the Issue may be closed after the justification is added to a comment.**  Also, the TriBITS Maintainer may offer to implement the changes themselves or ask another TriBITS Developer to do so if that is most appropriate.  However, regardless of who actually makes the proposed changes, the following steps should is still be followed.

<a name="process_create_pull_request"/>

2. **Create Pull Request:** After the concept/plan for the proposed change is approved in the GitHub Issue by the TriBITS Maintainer, then the TriBITS Developer should create a Pull Request performing the following steps:
   1. **Create a topic/feature branch** using a descriptive name containing the Issue ID (e.g. `123-some-great-feature`),
   2. The **TriBITS Maintainer** sets appropriate **`component` and `type` [Labels](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/labels)** on the PR.
   3. **Create commits with logs messages referencing the Issue ID** (e.g. `fix that thing (#123)`),
   4. The TriBITS Developer **creates a pull-request (PR)** by [pushing the topic branch to their fork](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) and then [creating the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) against the 'master' branch of the main TriBITS GitHub repository:
      1. List the GitHub Issue ID in the title (e.g. `Implements some great feature (#123)`)
      2. List the GitHub Issue ID in the body (e.g. `Addresses #123`)
   5. The **changes in the PR will automatically be tested** using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/wiki/TriBITS-CDash-Dashboard#github-actions-pull-request-testing).  Also, the PR allows for a well managed code review (comments for each line of the change, for example).  The pull request should then reference the original GitHub Issue in a comment  (i.e. `Addresses #123`).  (NOTE: A partial set of changes in a PR is fine to open it, just enough to start the code review process.)
   * **NOTE:** The TriBITS Maintainers should be given push access to the topic-branch used to create the PR.  That way, the contributors, TriBITS Developers and the TriBITS Maintainer can all push new commits to that branch in a more collaborative way and have the PR Issue get updated automatically.

<a name="process_code_review"/>

3. **Perform Code Review:**
   1. The **TriBITS Maintainer moves the PR to "In Review"** column to the [appropriate Kanban Project Board](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/projects?type=beta) and  **assigns the PR one or more TriBITS Reviewers and also assigns them to the PR Reviewers list**.
   2. When the **TriBITS Reviewer** is ready to start the review, they must **add a comment to the PR stating "I am starting my review"** to notify those subscribed to the PR.
   3. A **code review is performed by the TriBITS Reviewers**, continued changes are made by the TriBITS Developer to address feedback, and comments are added to the PR or the original Issue to drive the completion of the PR (whatever makes sense, but usually comments specific to the changes should be added to the PR while more general comments not specific to the PR should go into the associated GitHub Issue).  New updates to the PR branch can be pushed by the TriBITS Developer as changes are made to address feedback.  Each TriBITS Reviewer must post their official PR review (using the GitHub PR review feature, not as a single comment).

<a name="process_accept_pull_request"/>

4. **Accept Pull Request:**
   1. The TriBITS Maintainer will then either accept the PR (by optionally rebasing and merging the branch to main development branch) or will state what further issues must be resolved before the change can be incorporated.
   2. If the TriBITS Maintainer accepts the PR, they merge the PR.

NOTES:

* Changing Kanban stages (i.e. moving an Issue or PR from one column to another in a [GitHub Project](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/projects)) does not trigger a GitHub notification (see [here](https://github.community/t/projects-board-notification-when-moving-a-card-issue-between-two-columns/2278)) and therefore all communication/notifications to GitHub users subscribed to a GitHub Issue or PR must be done through adding Issue & PR comments. 
* All the assigned TriBITS Reviewers do not need to review or (if they performed a review) approve the PR.  (It is up to the judgment of the TriBITS Maintainer what criteria are necessary to merge a TriBITS PR.)
* Very simple changes can be attached to a GitHub Issue generated using `git format-patch` but the above process involving topic branches and PRs is preferred. 
* The above process is just a suggested process.  What is important are the [contribution requirements](#requirements) listed above are met.
